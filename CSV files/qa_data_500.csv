1,BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus),What are some bitter truths about life at IIT/BITS Pilani?,"Here are a few bitter truths about life at BITS Pilani and IITs in general that many are not known to 
The faculty no doubt is one of the best but they are more qualified in research work than in teaching.
The girl-to-boy ratio at IITs and BITS Pilani is deteriorating rapidly.
IIT students stay awake most part of the night and sleep early morning around 5 thus disturbing their sleep cycle tremendously.
The average IQ of IIT students is higher than people of the rest of the world yet the output is not particularly high
The attendance policy is a major hurdle here and even students with decent marks get detained.
The food served in the mess is hardly edible 
The highest package rarely reaches the CPA mark and if it does, it's usually an international package where the in-hand salary is much less.
Despite it all, IITs and BITS have excellent placement scenarios because the recruiting companies are well aware that these students will commit to work more than their capacity and thus prefer IITians over other people."
1,BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus),How much is the total fee of BITS Pilani per annum for a B.E. course?,"Yes, BITS Pilani is very costly and a student from a middle-class family may not afford the hefty fees here. The semester fee at BITS Pilani for integrated courses and higher degree courses is Rs 2,31,500 for the first and second semesters. This roughly amounts to double the fees of IITs. 
However, when you become a part of the BITS family, you will realize that every penny you spent was worth it. BITS does not charge fees for themselves, rather the high fees are reflected in the top-notch infrastructure, lab facilities, and huge campuses. Moreover, they are not funded by the government so they have no option but to charge high fees to maintain their standards. 
So if you failed to make it to the top IITs, go for BITS Pilani, it will not disappoint you. Just consider the high fees as a long-term investment that will fetch you good returns."
1,BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus),Is BITS Pilani very costly?,"BITS WILP is a two-year postgraduate level course, in which 15 specializations are offered by the university. It is a degree course that is completed mainly on weekends to enable students and professionals to gain a full-time degree course while continuing their professional pursuits.
Pros
You get associated with the BITS tag
You can do your PG alongside working
The course is rather easy and with the right dedication you can complete it in 2 yrs.
The syllabus is the same for both on and off-campus students
Cons
You won’t be able to sit for PG campus recruitment
Not many companies consider this degree valuable and thus makes it is difficult to land a job.
The admission criteria are rather flexible thus the peer pool is not very filtered.
Most of the subjects are from bachelors and lack relevance and rigor
There is no visible difference in the knowledge base of the students.
The classes are not conducted by the original BITS faculty.
In all, I think the cons overshadow the pros and don’t deem this course a very wise decision."
1,BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus),What is your review of BITS Pilani WILP?Does it consider to get lecturer job?,"There are many reasons why someone might choose BITS Pilani over IIT. Some potential factors could include:
Zero Reservation policy: The students are selected solely on the basis of merit and there is no reservation policy. Hence, every student has earned his seat proudly by his own efforts. 
Zero Attendance Policy: Another great aspect here is the zero attendance policy requiring students to skip classes at their own will. This ensures the students' own willingness to attend classes. Additionally, the lecture slides and Video lectures are uploaded on the BITS website.
Location: Away from the hustle and bustle of city life, BITS Pilani is located in a peaceful area with minimal life outside the campus. The students thus spend more time with each other strengthening the junior-seniors bonds even better.
Collaborations: BITS Pilani has many collaborations with foreign universities and follows a well-updated curriculum at par with global standards.
Timetable: The students of BITS are at complete freedom to decide their own teachers, time slots, and breaks. They are under no compulsion to follow a fixed schedule.
Dual Degree Program: Another major perk of BITE is its dual degree program that allows students to do an MSC + Btech degree.
Ultimately, the choice between BITS Pilani and IIT will depend on an individual's personal preferences and priorities."
1,BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus),Which college is better: IIT or BITS Pilani ?,"No, I don’t think BITS Pilani is overrated in any way. In fact, it deserves the hype it gets because of its standard of education and the opportunities it offers. 
BITS is certainly comparable to IITs in terms of academics and faculty. It only seems a bit lacking in terms of research although it has been improving gradually.
BITS tag makes it easier to secure a Master’s in foreign universities. The average GRE score for a BITSian is around 330/340. Thus portrays the excellent English-speaking culture of BITS.
Being a part of the BITS family gives you access to its elaborate alumni network. Its alumni are working successfully across the globe and can be found everywhere be it the UK, US, Germany, France, or Singapore.
BITS Pilani Practice School is a compulsory graduation requirement for all students that comprises Practice School I and Practice School II. Practice School I is an internship of 2 months for students at the end of their 2nd year and Practice School II is an internship of an entire semester, around 5 -5.5 months either in the odd semester or the even semester in the final year. 
We can safely conclude that BITS Pilani is nowhere overrated and it certainly deserves all the hype."
2,Institute of Chemical Technology - [ICT],What is the expected cutoff (JEE Mains) for ICT Mumbai?,"Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai (ICT Mumbai)offers admission to Btech in eight specializations with an overall intake of 136.

VIT Chennai will provide you access to top-quality education and will ensure you succeed in it. It is definitely one of the best places to do your graduation from."
4,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],How is Thapar University?,"Thapar University was established in 1956. When it was a young institution, it ranked among the top 20 universities/colleges in India, and its students achieved great heights. Even today, many students from this University do immensely well and bring honor to it. 
This institution has a long-standing reputation and its alumni work in top MNCs as well as are part of the Indian Civil Services. Some of the top companies where its alumni are presently working include- Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, Twitter, Cisco, Uber, VMWare etc.
Even though Thapar University is still a brand name, newly opened institutions like DAIICT, BITS Goa, BITS Hyd, etc. are outperforming it significantly. The university has seen a significant decline in its glorious days in the past. This is because since 2008, due to its owner’s financial constraints, the crowd quality has declined and things have become more money-driven. There are few hikes every year. Unlike before, there are around 1300-1500 students on campus in the present times.
Thus, Thapar University has fallen down from its days of glory and significant steps need to be taken to revive its lost glory."
4,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],"How much is the fees of Thapar University for a 4 years BTech programme, including all hostel fees, etc.?","Thapar University has a brand name, however, the ground reality for this university is not very pleasant and it is swiftly losing the qualities that defined it in its glorious past. The rankings of students enrolled in the university are going down each year. The administration is taking serious measures against the same, however, because of these measures the other students are suffering. One example is the strict entry and exit timings. 
Academically, your experience in this institution will differ according to your branch. The CSE branch has a cooperative faculty and lenient attendance criteria. This is not the case for other branches. In other branches, some faculty members may hold personal grudges against you while some may fail you for missing the required attendance mark (75%) by as small as 0.1%. The mess is below average and the classrooms are not very impressive.  The administration is very slow. 
However, there are positive points about Thapar University as well. The alumni from Thapar are placed in some of the best companies in India and abroad. It has some of the best synthetic courts in any engineering college in India. There are many teachers at Thapar University who serve as a source of inspiration to their students. Sports facilities for all the major sports are great. Placements at Thapar University are great and the labs are well updated. Even though Thapar is facing a drug problem, its teachers and administration are very active in trying to solve this issue.
Thus, even though Thapar University has outlived its glorious days, it has some positive points too. It is completely your choice whether or not you wish to take admission into it."
4,Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],How are the Computer Science placements at THAPAR UNIVERSITY?,"I am an alumnus of Thapar University. Back when I was a student, Dr. V.P. Aggarwal was one of the best teachers at Thapar.
Back in 2014, sir used to teach us KOM (Kinematics of Machines - UME 302). I would usually arrive late for all my lectures, and sit for them with almost no interest. But one of sir’s classes truly inspired me and changed my perspective on life. 
Our ESTs were nearing, and so those days very few students attended classes. Sir was teaching us a topic and at the end, he asked us for our doubts. All of us were sitting in a disinterested manner, almost as if forced to attend the lectures. This was when sir told us that he had come back to the university at 4 in the morning, straight from Jabalpur. 
He had come back specifically for our class. When we asked him why he took so much pain for a single class, he replied that it was duty to teach his students. He said he would have felt restless with the thought that maybe some student had a query that day which couldn’t be solved because of his absence.
He told us that for him duty was above everything else. He wanted all his students to work hard and stay motivated. That day changed my perspective on life, and made me realize the importance of hardwork.
This is why, for me, sir is one of the best teachers whom I studied under at Thapar University."
5,Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology - [IIST],Should I take aerospace engineering at IIST or ECE at MNNIT Allahabad?,"In the year 2020, the ranking of IIST was #33 by NIRF for B.Tech courses. On the other hand, MNNIT Allahabad was ranked #48th by NIRF for B.Tech courses. With excellent teaching staff, IIST is the 1st space institute in Asia to offer programs in space science and technology.
Admission:
IIST:
The candidate must have completed 10+2 with a minimum of 75% from a recognized boardin Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics.
A valid score in JEE Advanced is required.
The fees for the 1st year inAerospace engineering course is Rs. 96,800.
The total intake of the program is 60 seats.
MNNIT Allahabad:
Candidate must have completed 10+2 in Science stream with a minimum 75% marks.
Candidate must have passed the entrance exam, i.e., JEE Main.
For ECE 1st year, the feeis Rs 84,666.
The general cut off for home state students ranged from 3600 to 7128 and for other state students it is from 4615 to 6752.
Placements
In IIST:
Top recruitersare TCS, Adobe, Wipro, Mercedes Benz (India) Limited, Philips, Intel, Bosch, Cypress, UTC Aerospace Systems, etc.
The highest salary offered to the student of the institution was INR 10 LPA.

The highest salary offered to the students is INR 25.33 LPA and the average salary offered to the students is INR 10.95 LPA.
Choosing the subject depends on the individual itself. IISR will be really good if the candidate is very much interested in space and technology, as the institute primarily focuses only on space studies. Being a part of the 1st institute in the world to offer complete range of programs in space and technology will be plus point. Late Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was the former Chancellor of the University. The city life of Kerala is much better than Allahabad. Now, based on all the data and their interest the candidate can choose the subject and institute accordingly."
5,Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology - [IIST],"Which will be a better choice, 5 year MTech in IIT Bhubaneswar or 4 year chemical in IIT Hyderabad or aerospace in IIST?","M.Tech from IIT Bhubaneswar makes sense only if you are willing to study more on research-based topics of the subject. It is best if one is looking for a career in Teaching, Researching, etc. to further gain knowledge about the subject and not work in MNCs.
IIT Hyderabad ranks 8th in the Engineering category by NIRF 2020. The number of students who got placed from the Chemical Engineering department in the 2019 placements was 26. The average salary package offered to students with Chemical Engineering is 15 lakhs per annum.
IIST is a space institute under the Department of Space. The students from IIST are recruited as scientists and engineers in the Department of Space facilities and Indian Space Research Organization centers all over India. They receive a starting salary of 10 lakhs per annum. Facilities like Infrastructure, Library, sports facilities, Computer labs, clinics, Data centers in IIST are much better and well equipped than the IITs.
Thus it is your choice to opt for what course you are interested in."
6,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT Mesra],How is BIT Mesra as a college?,"BIT Mesa, also known as Birla Institute of Technology, Mesa, is known to be one of the most prestigious engineering and technical institutes in India. It offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in various fields of engineering, technology, applied sciences, management, and architecture. 
The college has a great emphasis on research and innovation and has ties with several national and international institutions. It is ranked among the top 50 institutions by almost all the ranking agencies. However, the right choice for one person may be wrong for the other, thus making it a matter of preference. So it’s better to
Visit the college personally
Speak to the current batch and faculty members 
Research the program you are willing to get enrolled in
BIT Mesra and all allied top colleges like IIT and NIT are not only normal colleges but institutes of national importance."
6,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT Mesra],How is BIT Mesra in terms of placement?,"Every coin has two sides and likewise, every institute has its strengths and weaknesses. BIT Mesra has a number of flaws pertaining to its education and culture. I have listed a few 
One of the biggest cons of this institute is that students aren’t encouraged or inclined towards research and innovations at all. All they care about is getting a decent GOA and eventually a job. 
The faculty is least interested in conducting quality research and discovery. They just conduct monotonous classes for the sake of it just to earn money.
The institute has excellent infrastructure but its utility is poor. There are supercomputers and computational tools, however, they aren’t used to the fullest to bring big achievements. 
Even in this age and era, students are judged on the basis of personal relationships, attendance count; and GPA. 
The focus on securing a high GPA has definitely affected the quality of education and resulted in a rat race for placements.
I really hope the institute makes amendments and brings about a massive research culture soon!"
6,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT Mesra],"Which among BIT, Mesra and MIT, Manipal is better in terms of academics, placements, faculty, internships, infrastructure, hostel and overall personality development?","There are various reasons combined together that have resulted in deteriorating education opportunities and quality at BIT Mesra. Despite the huge amount of funds ranging into hundreds of crores, the institute has been receiving, there is no improvement in the situation at all.  Here are a few reasons why BIT Mesra has suffered a deteriorating situation over the past few years
C.K. Birla Group is financially highly unstable and thus adds to the insecurity of the institute as a whole. 
The government of Jharkhand has bad ties with BIT because the CM of Jharkhand was kicked out of BIT without a degree.
The faculty is worse than VIT, Manipal, RVCE, etc. The poor quality of facilities is the major reason for its drastic downfall. Most of the professors are underqualified or not interested in teaching.
The college promotes zero research culture and this has resulted in a gradual downfall. 
There is a huge communication gap between the administration and students. Students should be given positions in administration and the administration should work on improving the facilities such as the incubation center for the betterment of the institute.
The T n P Cell is also responsible for the fall in the placements. They have minimal connections with alumni and fail to attract better companies.
The institute lacks International Collaborations for undergraduate internships and research. 
The students should work hard to bring about the above changes if they want to save their college from falling into the pit."
7,Amity University,What are the bad things about Amity University Noida?,"Some of my friends graduated from Amity University Noida. Following are the few things they complain about. 
Everyone is required to maintain a minimum attendance of 75%. Anyone who is unable to do so is barred from appearing in the examinations. 
Other than the course work students are required to study subjects like Environmental Studies, FBL, Behavior Science, etc. They have to give examinations for these courses as well. It adds extra stress. Often teachers aren’t interested in teaching these subjects as well.
There is no mess system. Even if you are a hosteller you will have to pay for breakfast, lunch, dinner daily.
Other than CSE, the placement scenario isn’t good. Only a few mass recruiters visit the campus placement.
A pointer system is used to analyze and calculate marks. Your actual mark will get reduced in this pointer scale system."
8,SRM Engineering College,No data found,No data found
9,SSN College of Engineering - [SSNCE],"Which college should I choose? SSN College Chennai, Amrita University Coimbatore or SASTRA University Tanjore?","You will be shortlisted based on your board score. The selection process is followed by a computer-based aptitude test and a personal interview session. My friend appeared for this exam and she had mentioned that the mathematics section was taken from JEE Main and there were certain questions based on logic.
The interviewers would ask for certain proofs of whatever you have accomplished. So, you would have to carry along your certificates as they ask about your participation in extracurriculars and look at the certificates as proof. These certificates can be of anything you have partaken in dancing, singing, drama or any other activity you like.
In the interview, they will consider things like your JEE marks, passions, and ambition in life. Plus, the obvious- why do you want to take admission in SSN College, and what all options do you consider as your backup options. This entire interview process checks what kind of a person you are in terms of talent. It will be an advantage if you can speak fluently in English."
9,SSN College of Engineering - [SSNCE],Which is better: Anna University or SSN?,"The hostel life at SSN College of Engineering is worth remembering. It is a place that unites all the students and builds innumerable memories apart from different cultural and financial backgrounds, therefore giving you a family-like feeling away from your home. There is complete privacy and freedom for all the students.
All the hostellers are attracted by the ambiance and at the same time, the hostel gives a complete study environment to all the students.
You end up making lots of friends with whom you can interact and exchange gossips regarding the various happenings.
There are different groups with whom you can debate on topics like cricket, or football leagues, discussing things regarding studies and whatnot.
The mess is not that good so students eat mostly in various cafes or streets building memories with friends.
Battling for water is one of the funniest incidents that often happen in the hostel. Students don't take bath for 2-3 days, which is considered part and parcel of college life.
The rooms are well-ventilated with comfortable cots so that the students feel very lazy and sometimes miss the morning class.
The hostel life at SSN College of Engineering is full of freedom, it is solely your responsibility to use that in a particular way. You should create a perfect balance between your fun and studies and at the same time, you can enjoy college life to the fullest."
10,SASTRA University,How good are placements at SASTRA university?,"I have a few friends from SASTRA University and here are a few of the pros and cons of the university according to them.
Pros:
It is the only private university in Tamilnadu to take admission through JEE Mains. Their admission process is merit-based and transparent.
The student crowd of the university is great. You will be in a competitive environment.
SASTRA University has the lowest fees among the universities of the same league.
Cons: 
The mess food is not that good.
My friends also complain about hostel facilities.
You won’t have many chances to visit home.
These are a few of the things that you need to know about SASTRA University."
10,SASTRA University,What are the pros and cons of studying in SASTRA University?,"Sastra University is one of the most reputed institutes in South India, especially for engineering. In 2020, it was ranked 50 for university and 38 for B.Tech by NIRF. I have a few friends from Sastra University. 
Here are some of the information regarding the institute that my friends shared.

Faculty and Curriculum: 
The faculty base of the institute is great. 
The curriculum was renewed recently. It is updated with the industry requirements.
Mark System and Scholarships:
Sastra follows a GPA system. Having a decent GPA can help you get scholarships and even a chance to sit for placement in reputed companies. If you have a GPA of around 8.5, you can sit for companies like Amazon, Cypress, etc. Although most companies allow students with a 7.5 CGPA to sit for placements.  
Placement: 
The placement record of the institute is great. In the 2021 placement drive, the highest CTC offered by the university was 27 LPA. 
Overall, Sastra University is great. It will offer great infrastructure, decent facilities, and placement at an affordable fee."
10,SASTRA University,How is Sastra University?,"I have a few friends from Sastra University. According to them, college life at Sastra is good. It offers decent academic facilities. Here are some of the things that you need to know about the institute.
Dress-code for boys is shirts, jeans or formal trousers. For girls, it’s Kurti or salwar. 
Hostel rules are more lenient for boys. They can stay out until 9 PM. Girls are only allowed to stay out till 6. 
Try to make a few friends, if you want to have a good hostel life. If you are from different states, you may feel isolated at first. But try to communicate with others, that way you can find like-minded people.
Overall, you will have good experiences at Sastra University."
11,Manipal Institute of Technology - [MIT],Which one is better: VIT or MIT Manipal?,"Yes, it’s definitely worth paying 16 Lakhs for Manipal Institute of Technology. However, you should change your mindset regarding ROI. You shouldn’t consider education as something that will give you an ROI instantly. You need to change that perspective else you won’t be able to fly high. It’s illogical to compare numbers like fees and salary packages. 
The primary purpose of education is to prepare you for life’s challenges. The place that gives you wings to fly. Basically, college life is about identifying yourself.
Manipal is an institute offering a plethora of opportunities. The crowd is from every nook and corner of the world, every walk of life and educational background. Manipal gives you the skills to actively participate in every field. The academics are delivered by some of the best faculty and non-academics are promoted through various clubs and committees. At the end of 4 years, MIT will give you clarity of thought and the confidence to lead your life on your own terms."
11,Manipal Institute of Technology - [MIT],Is it worth paying 16 lakhs for Manipal Institute of Technology?,"Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), Manipal is the first self-financing engineering college in India. The institute has been ranked 61 among the top engineering colleges in India by NIRF 2023. Based upon a few reviews the key aspects of this institute are as follows
A Thriving Campus Life: MIT is not just about academics; it's a vibrant hub of opportunities. You must join student clubs, including technical ones, to explore your passions beyond the classroom.

In conclusion, the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT) offers a dynamic campus life, a strong sports culture, diverse culinary options, and a balance between academics and recreation."
11,Manipal Institute of Technology - [MIT],What are your reviews of Manipal Institute Of Technology (Manipal)?,"As a student of Manipal Institute of Technology, here are some things I would like to share with you-
Campus Life- Manipal offers a great campus life. There are student clubs and technical clubs. Technical clubs include- The Solar Mobil Project and Formula Manipal. The dramatics societies don’t perform much but they are a great place for networking.
Sports facilities- The college has its own semi professional leagues- MIT Cricket League and MIT Football League. 
Food- The campus has good eateries including two Mexican restaurants. Even the hostel mess is decent over here.
Academics- The curriculum and labs need to be updated, especially for ME and CE. Over here, learning is theoretical rather than practical. Like any other engineering college, you’ll face lots of assignments and tests. Teachers give importance only to marks. This is especially true for CSE, EEE and ECE branches.
Faculty- The faculty for mechanical and civil is liberal and qualified. Unfortunately however, most teachers at MIT look down upon students with low grades.
Crowd- The crowd is quite diverse. You’ll interact with people from various cultural backgrounds. Manipal gives ample freedom and opportunities to its students for their personality development. However, the fees are very high.
Placements- Except for the top 10% in CSE and ECE, low packages are offered to students. Majority ends up getting mass recruited in brands like TCS. Student intake is increasing, and number of core companies visiting the campus is decreasing. Thus, very average placements are secured for such a high fee.
Higher Studies- Manipal will offer support for your higher studies. Opting for an MSc. after your graduation from Manipal, is a good option.
At Manipal you’ll develop good interpersonal skills. But the fees aren’t justified considering its faculty, academics and placement quality."
11,Manipal Institute of Technology - [MIT],What is your review of Manipal Institute Of Technology (Manipal)?,"If you work in a central government-funded institution, you will definitely receive the paycheque on time that is the last working day of the month. However, the situation may not be the same in state government institutions where salaries are not received on time.
I have a few friends in Kasturba Medical College, AIIMS, and JIPMER and all of them told me that they receive their salary exactly on the last day of the month.
However, many other less-reputed hospitals and medical colleges, dont pay their residents and interns or they receive the paycheck extremely late. I believe in order to create a strong healthcare system, we must cater to basic necessities such as paying the healthcare workforce on time."
11,Manipal Institute of Technology - [MIT],"Do the doctors and residents working in famous hospitals like AIIMS, Manipal, CMC, JIPMER and other top medical colleges get their paycheck on time?","Here is a rough estimate of the total expenditure for a BTech course at MIT Karnataka.
Total Tuition Fees ( BTech): INR 18.62 Lakhs 
Hostel + Mess fees: Around 4–5 Lacs depending on the hostel you choose
Travel expense: On average you will be spending 750-1000 per month. So the cost of a 9-month stay for 4 years will be 1000*36= INR 36000
Travel expense from home to college: This varies from person to person because if you live far away, you will have to travel by airplane. Assuming, you will be taking 4 trips a year, the cost will be around 1 Lakh.
Misclieous Expenses: Around INR 5000 per month. So 5000 x 9 x 4 = 180000 INR.
The above estimate does take into account the money you spend partying or going on trips. Also, it's important to note that the above estimate is purely based on my speculations and may vary from person to person."
11,Manipal Institute of Technology - [MIT],"Which among BIT, Mesra and MIT, Manipal is better in terms of academics, placements, faculty, internships, infrastructure, hostel and overall personality development?","Manipal Institute of Technology has one of the best hostel facilities in India.

13,Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology,How good is placement at Sathyabama University?,"I completed my B.Tech from Karunya University, but I can tell you a bit about Sathyabama as well. 
Sathyabama offers decent academics, good quality mess food, and good placements. But it is located very far away from the main city (Chennai). Moreover, its infrastructure is not up to the mark. Its biggest disadvantage is that students of the opposite gender are penalized for even interacting with each other. Boys and girls are separated right from the counseling process. 
Karunya University is located in a beautiful and serene landscape, and surrounded by mountains on all sides. It has good infrastructure and quality education. Its placements are average. Its hostels are good, and the mess food is good as well. It has strict rules only for first years. It has a diverse student population, with students from other Indian states and countries as well. Hostel is mandatory for B.Techs, but not for some degrees. 
It charges high fees, and some of its departments have poor placements. The rules are very strict about clean shaving. The faculty takes out personal grudges on students’ internal grades. Most of the hostels are located far away from the campus. 
According to me, Anna University affiliated colleges are much more affordable for B.Tech studies. So you may consider them instead of these two universities."
13,Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology,How can you get admission in Sathyabama University and Hindustan University?,"If you want better education, good placements, and decent living standards, join Sathyabama University. On the other hand, if you want an affordable college and cheaper living standards, join LNCT Bhopal. Even LNCT offers decent placements, so do not worry on that front.
Make your choice based on your family’s economic condition. If there’s no financial constraint, I would recommend you opt for Sathyabama University."

14,Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],"Is KIIT a better option than VIT, MANIPAL, SRM, or less renowned NITs like NIT Surat, Jaipur, Raipur, etc.?","Here is a review of KIIT University based on the experience of a close friend who is now an alumnus of the institute
Pros
The institute offers a vibrant and happening campus life filled with fun activities.
The institute gives extra attention to extracurricular activities and has a plethora of platforms through which one can pursue their passion.
The accommodation facilities are decent and the hostel rooms are spacious. Hygiene is maintained 
The institute has excellent infrastructural facilities like a gym and swimming pool that charge money.
Cons
KIIT fees are high and not everyone can afford it. This year the annual fees stood at ?3.5 Lakhs 
The faculty pool has average professors and very few are highly experienced.
The institute also faces issues due to the huge batch size.
The research culture and the lab sessions are poor and need to be worked on.
The curfew for girls' hostels is another big concern here. The girls are expected to be inside the hostel by 7 30.
Placements are decent considering the huge fees you have paid. There are several mass recruiters so getting placed won’t be a major problem.
In all, KIIT is a good choice if you have no financial constraints and want to live a luxurious campus life."
14,Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],What is your review of KIIT University?,"Here is a detailed year-wise description of life at KIIT University.
First-year
The boys are usually allocated King's Palace VII while girls are allotted Queens Hostel. The hostels are massive with 4 floors and 100 rooms on each floor in a single block and each hostel has 8 blocks. The students are kept under discipline and given to come back to the hostel by 7 and wear formal till the freshers' party.
The hostel life is fun and the fresher's party marks a new freedom to break some rules and explore the huge campus.
The first year is fun. You can hang out with your friends, explore the campus and go to restaurants.
Students are provided with laptops in the first year. 
Students are allotted mentors who will guide them.
Second Year
The second year will bring in a lot of freedom as new rules will be made. No more dress code and the new hostel with have a check-in time of 10 pm.
This is the best time to explore your passions. The KSAC will guide you in the same. 
This is the best time to enjoy the KIIT Fest.
The third-semester exams are pretty challenging so you need to brace yourself.
Third Year
This is the best time to upgrade your CV by pursuing some professional courses and other activities. This is the best year to prepare for your placements and future in general.
Students spend time learning at least one programming language thoroughly. You can seek guidance from seniors and teachers. 
Fourth Year
This year is the placement year and that’s what you will be busy with throughout the year.
There will be no classes and only placement training classes will be there. 
This is the most serious time as everyone will be busy planning their future.
Ultimately, make sure you make the most of every year!"
14,Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],What's the present scenario of placements in KIIT?,"Whether a particular degree is worth the money you spend depends on a number of factors like your financial background and your future prospects. One of my relatives completed his BTech in CSE in 2012 and got a job that helped him pay back the loan within 2 years. However, this may not be the case for everyone. That being said, consider the following scenarios
If you have zero financial constraints and want to live a dreamy college life, then KIIT is certainly the best place for you. 
If your parents have been saving money for you, save that for your Master's and do your Bachelors in IITs or NITs instead.
If you have financial issues and loam is the only option, then leave that option for Master
Nevertheless, if you are adamant about joining anyways, go for CS or IT which will provide better placement opportunities than other branches."
14,Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],How is life at the KIIT University in detail?,"Yes, KIIT is a great college in terms of both education and faculty. One of my friends completed his BTech in Civil Engineering from KIIT and was glad of his decision. The faculty base comprises a mix of highly learned professors and fresh post-graduates generally from IITs or other reputed colleges. But the major issue here is the quality of students getting admission here. KIIT usually averages students who could not make it into other engineering colleges. 
No matter how good the teachers are, the level of education can never be great if the students are average and have no interest in studying. Because of the luxurious life the institute offers, students have started taking faculty and education in general for granted. They can be seen frequently skipping classes and exams. This carefree approach toward studies is causing major problems and is destroying the academic ambiance as well as the career of many. 
Owing to such an attitude on the part of students, the professors too have little interest in teaching. They dont run behind students and have found comfort in their laid-back attitude. So, the faculty although good is of no use if the students are not willing to extract benefits from them."
15,Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University - [SOA],"What's best college among BPUT, SOA (ITER) & KIIT in terms of placements?","KIIT is the best technical college in Orissa, in terms of placements too. Its students get placement offers before the 8th semester itself. But on average, the offers aren’t very attractive. Plus, the fee of KIIT is much higher compared to ITER and BPUT. 
My cousin was a bright student at KIIT. He received a good on campus placement. On the other hand, I was a BPUT graduate. Though I was also good at studies, I had to look for off campus placements due to lack of on campus offers. 
But my knowledge and hard work eventually paid, and I got a good job with a good package. At present, my cousin and I get an equal salary, and we are both working in different companies in the US. 
KIIT is the best for on campus placements. ITER is not as good, but much better than BPUT. But my point is, even if you end up in ITER/BPUT because of financial constraints or some other reason, do not give up hopes. At the end of the day, your hardwork and determination is all that matters."
16,K L University - [KLU],What is your review of K L University?,"Both institutes will offer you placements in the field of software and very few core company opportunities. 
The architecture course in KLU is good and maintains discipline. In terms of campus and infrastructure, KLU has a superior view. Vignan University, on the other hand, has an average campus. 
You must choose KLU as it is updated with the latest education policies and equipment. In the placement drive held in KLU in 2021, the results have been near perfect when it came to placing the students in companies and firms that are reputed, in turn, resulted in 100% placement.
A total of 65 students got placed and the highest package offered to the students was INR 7 LPA. The average package offered was 3.5 LPA. More than 60 companies visited the campus. TCS offered 267 jobs and Cognizant offered 121 jobs."

18,R V College of Engineering - [RVCE],"What is life like at RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru?","According to the NIRF 2020 rankings, RV College was ranked 70th in India. On the other hand, PES University was ranked at the 93rd position. Both of these colleges are having a good placement record. 
The different categories based on which we can compare the two colleges are listed below:
Placements: 
PES University Placement drives offered 1185 job offers last year and placed 605 UG & 31 PG students in reputed companies. The highest CTC of INR 49.75 LPA was offered to one of the B.Tech students. The average salary comes out to be around INR 6 to 6.5 Lakhs per annum for both the UG and PG Students. The top recruiters that visit the campus include:
Microsoft
Cisco
Accenture
Oracle
Adobe
Wipro
Honeywell
Cognizant
HP
Flipkart

For RVCE, the highest salary package offered last year was INR 49.75 Lakhs per annum as per the college’s website. 967 offers have been made in the year 2021 and 183 companies have visited the campus as of April 2021. The Companies that visit the campus almost every year include:
PayPal
Flipkart
Infosys
Intel Technology
Intuit
GENPACT
Deltax
Amazon
Linkedin
Deloitte
Ericsson
Adani Group
Faculty: Both the colleges have excellent faculty, so there are no clear winners that can be declared based on this parameter. The Teachers are highly qualified in their respective fields.
Syllabus: PES University has a more relevant syllabus than RVCE but the professors' methodology to teach at PES University is not satisfactory. RVCE has a modern syllabus for core branches, but it still lags compared to other top colleges in the country.
Students: After considering and analyzing the CET cutoffs and enrollment data we can conclude that RVCE is the choice of the majority of the toppers. 
Campus: RVCE has a larger campus as compared to PES University but the campus of PES University is better maintained. 
RVCE College can be said to be No.1 but choosing PES University can not be considered a bad choice. You should try and consider other factors as well before making the final decision. You can choose either of the two colleges and can still make it big in life."
19,Ramaiah Institute of Technology - [RIT],Which is better for computer science: BMS Institute of Technology or MS Ramaiah?,"One of my cousins completed her MBA from M.S Ramaiah only recently and can put his opinions in a better way. MSRIM is in fact situated close to the M.S Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, while RIMS at New Bel Road. Here is a detailed outlook of the overall MBA program of the institute as my cousin mentions,
Course Offerings:
Speaking in terms of education, MSRIT offers dual specialization in both Marketing in Human Resources and Marketing in Finance, out of which Marketing is the compulsory elective.
Placement Reports:
However, with regard to placements, it is not up to the mark since it is an autonomous institute. It is due to the fact that MSRIT is primarily known for B.Tech and the placement of it is usually top tier, unlike its MBA program. Here are the placement highlights of M.S Ramaiah (MSRIM) of recent years.

19,Ramaiah Institute of Technology - [RIT],"Which amongst these engineering colleges is the best for a CSE: BMSCE, MSRIT or PES University?","MS Ramaiah (MSRIT) is considered as one of the top engineering colleges in Karnataka and is among the top 50 institutes across India as per the preferences of potential candidates. It has an all-India reputation of being a decent institute. But BIT Sindri is mostly known among the people of Jharkhand only.
Among the two institutes, MS Ramaiah is the better option due to the overall placement scenario, exposure in the corporate and IT industries, and several other reasons listed below.

Placement (Winning institute- MS Ramaiah):
MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology is situated in the IT hub of India, Bangalore. Having exposure to thousands of companies nearby, several companies visit the campus for placement.
MS Ramaiah has seen close to 250 companies in its placement sessions, which is undoubtedly a huge number. BIT Sindri, situated in Dhanbad has its placement statistics nowhere close to MS Ramaiah in this case.
So, MS Ramaiah is undoubtedly a clear winner among the two institutes. It can be assumed that anyone among the top 10 institutes in Karnataka is a better choice than BIT Sindri, looking into the matter of IT exposure."
20,International Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT-B],"I got NIT Surathkal ECE and IIIT Bangalore CSE. I am joining IIIT Bangalore CSE, is it a good decision?","The Machine Learning course by Upgrad and IIIT Bangalore extensively covers ML and AI. All the necessary topics, from Basic Mathematics and statistics to Deep Learning and Graphical Models, are included in this course. 
It isn’t a certificate program, rather you’ll earn a PG diploma. Unlike other MOOCs, this course demands serious effort from participants. It is a year-long rigorous course. Mathematics, SQL, and Python are well-taught to lay a strong foundation. The professors are well-experienced, and frequent live sessions are conducted for doubt-solving. 
Assignments are topic-relevant, and their submissions are taken seriously. The TAs are supportive. You’ll be assigned a mentor to help you with non-academic queries/issues. Frequent sessions are held with industry experts to equip students with information on the latest developments in the field. 
The assignment timeline is very rigid, and modules are released only on Sundays. So working professionals may suffer some inconvenience with this course."
20,International Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT-B],Is it worth doing a post graduate diploma degree in data analytics from IIIT Bangalore?,"PGDDA by IIIT Bangalore and UpGrad is one of the best online courses for Data Analytics. Here are some reasons why you can consider taking this course-

The certificate you’ll get on completion of this course will immensely aid your professional growth.
Upgrad will provide you with ample placement assistance.
This is a good course, and I would personally recommend you take it."
20,International Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT-B],How are placements in IIIT-Bangalore for M.Tech (computer science)?,"IIIT Bangalore provides students with a unique blend of academic excellence, personal growth, and vibrant campus experiences.
Hostels: IIIT Bangalore has three awesome hostels - Bhaskara, Lilavati, and Visvesvaraya. Bhaskara is where the boys reside, and it's got triple-sharing rooms for the first two years and sweet single occupancy rooms from the fourth year onwards. Lilavati is the place for the girls, offering 260 rooms with top-notch security and daily housekeeping. Additionally, there's a gym called ""Calorie Bee"" for staying fit.

21,BMS College of Engineering - [BMSCE],Which college is good for electrical and electronics engineering (EEE): PES University or BMSCE?,"If you are interested in CSE then choosing the Amritapuri campus of Amrita University Bangalore will be better. One of my friends is a student of Amritapuri and so far he had a good experience at the institute. Here are some of the aspects of the institute.
Campus: The campus is great and offers a decent academic environment. It has smart classrooms and a library with a good collection of books for different branches. There is no distraction due to politics.
Academics: Academics at the campus is as good as you can expect from an engineering campus. The faculties are experienced. There is enough research exposure. The computer lab is well-equipped.
Opportunities:
There are three active clubs, i.e. FOSS, Cyber Security, ICPC.
You can take part in international programming competitions under the guidance of experts in programming.
You can also take part in internship programs like GSoC, Outreachy, etc.
The institute also has exchange programs with reputed institutes in Europe and United States.
Hostel and Food:
The hostel rooms are spacious and well-furnished. There are facilities such as wifi, reading rooms, etc.
The food provided at the mess is mostly vegetarian. It is not that testy. But there are canteens and restaurants nearby.

Students get recruited by reputed companies like Google, SAP Labs, CISCO, etc.
So, going by the factors mentioned above, it is safe to say that you can’t go wrong with Amrita University Amritapuri campus."
22,Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences - [Karunya Deemed University],What is your review of Karunya University?,"There are several reasons for this, including the fact that Karunya generally advertises only in the southern regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. As a result, there will be more students from here. Most North Indian students who come here learn about Karunya through alumni. Students are not given many opportunities to showcase their talents, such as singing and dancing. Doing dance numbers to Bollywood/Hollywood songs, for example. There is one thing to point out even though Karunya believes in a value-based education system yet prayers are given more weight than studies.
In comparison to other universities, there is little freedom. Most people, especially outsiders mistake this location for a Christian conversion site, which is completely false. The majority of KU alumni are dissatisfied with the university. People only ask them if they should go to Karunya at the end of the day.
Despite this, Karunya is an excellent place to study. All Karunyans need is a little more exposure to the outside world."
22,Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences - [Karunya Deemed University],Is Karunya University too strict?,"Karunya University is certainly one of the most sought-after engineering colleges. It does have a religious environment although students aren’t forced to participate in any such activities. It has a very well-maintained Infrastructure with many experienced faculties, most of whom are P.hDs. They have MOAs signed with foreign universities.
Karunya has an IAESTE chapter on their campus that facilitates students to go abroad for internships. Karunya also has its own campus radio and TV channel that airs cricket and football matches.
Overall, you will get many opportunities to showcase your talents."
23,Kumaraguru College of Technology - [KCT],Is Sri Krishna College of Technology better than Kumaraguru College of Technology in Coimbatore?,"One of my friends was a part of the 2017 MCA batch of Kumaraguru College of Technology. According to her, the atmosphere at the institute is great and it offers decent academics. 
The campus life is quite enjoyable. You will get to meet many people on the campus. The college is not that strict about attendance so you can bunk classes and explore the campus on bicycles with your friends. 
The hostel facilities are great. The rooms are 4-sharing and food provided on mess is good. 
KCT collaborates with good companies for the management of campus facilities and always ensures the convenience of the students. The average salary package here is 1.5 LPA while 28 LPA has been recorded as the highest salary.
It has also started Arts and Science faculties within the campus and hence, gives more freedom to make good friends. 
“YUGAM” the cultural fest of the KCT provides the opportunity to showcase your talent and expertise in the particular field to the students. 
You will definitely have a good time at KCT."
23,Kumaraguru College of Technology - [KCT],What is your review of Kumaraguru College of Technology?,"One of my classmates graduated from Kamaraguru and he mentioned a few disadvantages which he noticed while studying there. 
The placement is not good here and you might not get any job offers. Most of my brother’s batchmate remained jobless
The teachers focus on delivering the lessons. The education quality can be improved by increasing more research work, fieldwork, and creating projects.
Due to involvement in extracurricular groups, students miss their classes or studying seriously. As a result, they don’t get enough knowledge about their courses and hence, fail to get placements.
The campus is very big and you might find difficulty in covering the distance from classrooms to other places like the canteen, labs, and hostels. You have to walk on foot to cover the distance.
Another concern is the Girls’ Hostel, the girls weren’t allowed to move out from the Hostel after a set time, 6:40 pm. This is quite early for girls but this is the rule hence, they follow but aren’t happy about it."
24,Punjab Engineering College University of Technology - [PEC],"Is PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh good?","After IITs, PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh is the best option in North-India. The university has a decent faculty base. You can get their help regarding any problem related to academics. PEC offers good facilities and resources. The campus is equipped with high-speed internet. 
It has a good placement record. PEC Chandigarh placements 2021 ended with an average CTC of INR 10.83 LPA. Some of the major recruiters that took part in the placements were Airtel, Microsoft, Google, American Express, etc. 
PEC has a pretty active club culture. Other than technical clubs, there are clubs for music, debate, music, dance, art, photography, etc."
25,Jaypee Institute of Information Technology University - [JIIT],"Getting CSE at Thapar University as well as Jaypee Noida (JIIT) , which college should I choose?","CSE at JIIT is clearly better than ECE at Thapar. You must have a minimum JEE rank of 51,000 to get CSE at JIIT Noida. 
There are no state quota, caste quota, or NRI quota at JIIT but Thapar offers a 50% quota for Punjab state students. This results in a superior quality of students at JIIT Noida than Thapar. Due to quotas and an increase in the number of seats, anyone can get admission at Thapar University.
If a student has a 300,000 rank in JEE Main, he will not be able to gain a seat anywhere, but if he is from Punjab, he may be able to secure a place in Electrical Engineering in Thapar. This explains how Thapar's situation has deteriorated.
JIIT will offer you great exposure which is actually required in CSE with regular industrial visits. CSE has more scope in terms of placements than ECE."
25,Jaypee Institute of Information Technology University - [JIIT],"Which college is better between USIT, MAIT, JIIT, and BVP for a BTech in Computer Science/IT?","MAIT is ranked as the 3rd Best College in Delhi by India Today and ranks within 200 nationally.

Both the colleges admit students based on their JEE Main scores.
The general cut-off for MAIT in-state students is 65,157 and out-of-state students are 37,689.
The closing rank for IT at JIIT is 59,407.
Faculty and curriculum:
MAIT provides an extensive course structure with excellent faculty and conducts regular workshops and industrial visits, whereas JIIT provides an updated, and relevant course curriculum and faculties are Ph.D. holders from IITs and foreign universities.
Placements:
Students securing a rank within 2000 in the GGSIPU college Btech examination are favored for on-campus job placements at MAIT.

The campus is ragging free and seniors are quite helpful. The 85% Delhi quota at the institute brings affluent crowds of Delhi to the campus.
The placement process is managed by talented students of the institute. The placement at the institute is great. Even though it is an engineering college the non-technical placement rate of the institute is impressive. 
Even if you realize after a few months of your course that engineering is not for you, you will still get to learn a lot from the campus culture."
26,Indian Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],How is IIIT - Allahabad main campus?,"It's possible that IIIT Delhi is superior to IIIT Allahabad because of its prime location and excellent faculty and placement statistics.
IIIT Allahabad is also a National Institute of Importance, but IIIT Delhi is not.
The coding culture isn't even close to being equivalent; IIIT-D is far superior.
Professors at IIIT-D are generally PhDs from prominent universities throughout the world, therefore their experience and letters of recommendation are quite valuable.
Another plus for Delhi is that the research climate is excellent, especially for undergraduates.
Technically, neither has “100%” placements, but their placements are extremely similar overall—Delhi to Allahabad.
The differential in tuition prices is the most compelling reason to pick IIIT Allahabad over IIIT Delhi.

Your Academic merit.
YourJEE Mains score
Then a Personal interview conducted by the institute.
There is no entrance exam for B.Tech. The admission will be based on the collective score of the above mentioned points."
28,Mepco Schlenk Engineering College,"What is your review of Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi?","Mepco Schlenk is a strict disciplinarian college. Life at the college is miserable and it’s all about surviving there. Grave importance is given to id-cards, attendance, black shoes (compulsory for every student), and maintenance of classroom decorum. The college has installed phone booths so that students can communicate with their parents at any given time. 
The faculty is amazing, along with this the college provides the students with the best resources like lab facilities, library access, etc. For relaxation purposes, they have a well-maintained gym, a ground, an indoor stadium, and an auditorium as well.
There are a few pointers which the students need to remember throughout their academic session –
The conversation between boys and girls is not allowed.
The college has the right to suspend students in the case of broken rules.
CCTV cameras are installed throughout the campus even in the classrooms.
Marking impression on teachers is prevalent among the students.
The placement rate is 90% (According to 2020 statistics)
Mobile phones are banned within the campus, hostel included.
Major Drawbacks
You can participate in presentations and tech workshops only if you have scored 7.5 CGPA and above. The rest of the students are not allowed to take part in these events.
The college authority assumes a monarchial stature in decision-makings which means it is not open for discussion or changes.
The placement rate is considerate, but there is a drawback- if you are selected by a company, then you won’t be allowed to sit for the interviews for another company that comes afterward.
You will be constantly pressurized if you have any backlog, regarding your performance, by the faculty, staff, and fellow mates as well.
Delay in time is unacceptable, if the student is late for five minutes then they will be marked absent for that entire period.
However, the college is not built solely on bad attributes, there are some good features as well such as -
The campus is extremely safe for the girl students with watchmen appointed at every two blocks.
The quality of food is good and the drinking water supplied is purified and fit for use by the students.
The convention center is ginormous, as big as the Nehru stadium.
The anti-ragging policy is implemented seriously.
The infrastructure is great, with well-equipped labs.
It is a very good college in terms of academia and high placement rates. However, the final choice depends on the person who is considering to opt for this college. All the best for your future."
28,Mepco Schlenk Engineering College,"Which college is better, Kongu or MEPCO?","Students aren't allowed to keep mobile phones in college. However, there are two landline phones at the hostel.
You can only call one number which you have previously given in the joining.
In college, you will not be able to keep your mobile phone with you. They will hold your phone for a week and fine you Rs 2000.
Also, you will be suspended for one week. Your phone will be returned to you after that.
The second time, you will be warned about your behavior.
The third time, you will be dismissed from the hostel.
There are good rooms available near the bus stop, but some of the food is not hygienic. If you choose to live near a bus stop, there are some affordable rooms available. Food might not be very hygienic (health-wise), but you can feel free in your room."
28,Mepco Schlenk Engineering College,Are mobile phones allowed at Mepco Schlenk Engineering College?,"One of my close friends studies at Mepco Schlenk Engineering College. According to him, like any other Engineering college, Mepco has its own rules which are strictly regulated. Few major rules are listed below:
Students are strictly not allowed to carry mobile phones inside the college campus.
From your second year, you are allowed to use laptops for which 15 GB internet is given each at hostel and academic block.
Unless there is an utmost requirement, you are not allowed to interact with the opposite gender unnecessarily.
There is a strict dress code on campus. You have to wear black shoes without any designs on a regular basis.
Girls are only allowed to wear traditional Indian attire like saree or salwar. Boys are supposed to wear formals.
These rules are formulated to inculcate good values in students. As cell phones are strictly prohibited, many students find it difficult to survive at the institute. But if you look at the positive aspects, you will learn patience and endurance and you will be totally focused throughout your academic years at Mepco."

Considering factors like placement, brand reputation, and coding culture. 
The points below give a brief overview of some of the advantages of choosing DAIICT over SVNIT.
According to some professors of SVNIT itself, DAIICT is a better institute for CSE and IT, compared to SVNIT.
The overall placement statistics of DAIICT are far better than that in SVNIT, with more high-paying jobs offered in the institute. 
DAIICT doesn’t have as good a reputation as NITs in India. But, in companies like Amazon, MAQ, Morgan Stanley, etc, DAIICT has a far better reputation than SVNIT.
There is an excellent open-source coding environment in DAIICT. 
The number of GSoC entries from both institutes makes it evident that DAIICT has much more success in open-source contribution.

There is a good environment for competitive coding too in DAIICT. In every notable coding contest from platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, etc, there are at least 30-40 participants from DAIICT."
30,Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology - [DA-IICT],"Between IIIT Allahabad,IIIT Delhi, DTU, NSIT, DAIICT, NIT Calicut, which college should I choose for pursuing CS?","One of my friends secured an AIR (All India Rank) of 7,000 in JEE Main 2017 and obtained a seat in NIT Surat in CSE. It is a good option since the institute is well renowned. More than that, he also decided to visit DA-IICT, Gandhinagar. 
Here is his experience of DA-IICT, Gandhinagar with better references - 
The professors are well experienced and have Ph.D. from reputed universities. Several faculty members received prestigious awards from being a secretary of IEEE to Padma Shri.
The course curriculum of the institute is dynamic and specialized. It is updated from time to time, to keep industry-relevant.
DA-IICT selects only about 350 candidates from the total number of students in B.Tech. They get selected for GSOC (which is, Google Summer of Code) every single year in large quarters.
The coding culture of DA-IICT is equally accomplished as is in IIIT Hyderabad and IITs. There are several ACM-ICPC World Finalists from DA-IICT. Apparently, unlike other well-reputed universities, DA-IICT students are passionate about coding.
  To support the answer, here is a table that distinguishes both of them,

30,Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology - [DA-IICT],What should I choose between SVNIT CS or DAIICT?,"As a student of SVNIT, I can only shed light on my college. 
Placements- The placements for B.Tech CSE are decent at SVNIT. It is a fact however, that no college can guarantee 100% placements, and a lot will depend on your knowledge and skill set. 
During 2022, 94 students of B.Tech CSE, out of 106 registered students, were successfully placed from the campus. 44 LPA was the highest package offered, the average package was 15.22 LPA, and the lowest package was 5.56 LPA. 
Infrastructure and Campus- The SVNIT infrastructure has been recently renovated, and all the departments have been shifted to the new building. The campus is huge and lush green, and you’ll see many peacocks roaming around. The campus is located in the center of Surat city, in a posh locality, and everything is easily accessible in the area. There are plenty of hangout spots near the campus.
Faculty and Hostels- The faculty of Computer Science department is good. The hostels are pretty good. SVNIT has some of the best hostels among the NITs and IITs. The hostel area, canteen, library and departments have LAN connectivity and Wifi facility, and there’s no usage limit.
National Recognition- SVNIT is an Institute of National Importance. It is well recognized in the entire country. But I am not sure if SVNIT is internationally recognized. 
SVNIT is a good college for B.Tech CSE. You can definitely consider it for your engineering studies."
31,Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University Pune,"How is the Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University College of Engineering, Pune?

The professors are friendly and cooperative. Every student is mentored in their studies and projects. 
BVUCOE has a technical fest. During the fest, students can present their innovative ideas under the guidance of teachers and mentors. 
Bharati Vidyapeeth Pune placements are pretty good. The placement average is more than 80%. The average CTC offered during the last placement drive was INR 5 LPA."
31,Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University Pune,What is your review of Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University?,"MSIT, MAIT, and BVP are all are reputed colleges with their own advantages. The choice depends upon various factors and the one that seems convenient to you. Consider the following points.
The commutation time is more at MSIT. It is crucial to saving your traveling hours to be productive. You can join if commutation is easy for you.
MAIT has a casual approach. You need not worry about attendance or internal markings.
BVP Pune is a strict institute. They look for attendance and internal markings based on your performance. You cannot expect any grace marks or partiality. It has an AC campus.

For the E&TC branch, the placement scenario and the packages that are provided are both good. CS&IT branches have average placement records. For Civil, the placement record is not that good. The studies at the Mechanical Department are good and tougher as compared to other branches. There, you would find a group of faculty members who are seniors and much more experienced in their subject domain.
According to 2020 placement highlights, the average package which is offered is around 7 LPA. The highest placement that was offered went up to 12 LPA.
Getting good placement also depends a lot on your efforts. The campus is green and beautiful."
32,Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science - [HITS],"How's Hindustan University, Chennai?","I am a student of B.Tech CSE at Hindustan University, pursuing a specialization in IBM cloud computing and virtualization. 
The CSE department is quite good. All its professors are friendly and supportive. The university focuses a lot on extracurriculars, even more than the academics. A number of workshops and events are regularly organized on campus. 
If you abide by the rules and regulations, you won’t face any trouble from the authorities. You will be offered a nurturing environment and ample growth opportunities. 
Hindustan University is a good choice for a CSE, given that you participate in events and make use of all the opportunities."
32,Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science - [HITS],What is your review of Hindustan University?,"Overall, Hindustan University is average at best. 
The quality of education offered is not good. Most faculty members are fresh graduates and don’t have much experience. 
The institute doesn’t have a good infrastructure. Although the institute claims to offer a good Aeronautical or Aerospace program, they don’t have good facilities or faculties to back up the claim. Besides a subsonic wind tunnel and four broken-down plans, the department offers zero facilities. 
Hindusthan University fees are pretty steep. The B.Tech Aeronautical Engineering program costs around INR 14.39 Lakhs. 
The institute doesn’t offer any internships or co-op opportunities to students. The placement opportunities offered aren’t worth the high course fee. 
The college lacks basic amenities that are essential for the overall growth of the students."
32,Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science - [HITS],How is Hindustan University for aerospace engineering?,"Hindustan University is an excellent platform for your growth and development. Apart from providing you with a degree, it will also ensure that you become a skilled engineer. 
Faculty- The faculty is mostly supportive. They will encourage you to take up projects, and not be stuck with just textbook learning. There are mostly young teachers.
Innovation Cell- There is an innovation cell at the University that encourages innovative ideas within the students. Since its inception, the college has witnessed around five new startups. Events are hosted regularly by this cell, and distinguished speakers are invited. They will help you grab internships, regardless of which year you belong to.
Hostel- Hostel facilities are a bit lacking. The mess food takes some time to get used to.
Extracurriculars- The university has five horses which take part in competitions regularly. Horse riding classes are held at 6 in the morning. Apart from hostel facilities, every other facility is good, and at par with what has been mentioned in the university website.
Vigilance Officers- They are like the police officers of the university. If you abide by university rules, they won’t trouble you in any form. 

Hindustan University is mainly known for three branches- Mechanical, Aerospace and Aeronautical. The university is good and you can definitely consider it for your studies."
32,Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science - [HITS],How is Hindustan University?,"I don't know much about CBIT and Hindustan University. But I won’t recommend you the NCR campus of SRM.
It is in fact not located in the National Capital Region. It is situated in Modinagar (Sikrikalan to be precise).The management of this college is very poor. You’ll be wasting a lot of energy for simple requests like getting statements attested, acquiring a recommendation letter, getting fee refunds, etc.
I studied CSE over there. The faculty for CSE is considered to be the best. However, in reality, most teachers don’t even have an idea of their specialization. You’ll find that the same teacher is taking classes for various specializations like Data Structures, Mobile Computing, Theory of Computation, Compiler, etc. New ideas aren’t encouraged in the classroom. 
The hardware in CSE labs is top notch, but the software is all outdated. The hostels are decent but the mess food is disappointing. The hostel wardens do minimum to maintain discipline. For placements, you’ll have to travel all the way to Chennai, with no support from the management, and no accommodation facilities. 
Thus, do not choose the NCR campus of SRM University, especially for the CSE program."
32,Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science - [HITS],How are placements at Hindustan university?,"Hindustan University is lenient in comparison to other institutions in Chennai. But there are some rules that you should follow as its student-
Always wear your identity card inside the campus. Otherwise, you’ll be caught by the vigilance officers. Without an id card, you won’t be entitled as a student of this university.
You can bring your vehicles inside the campus. However, be sure to wear a helmet.
This is quite obvious, do not use your phone while the teacher is taking a lecture. Also, don’t use your phone when standing near Java Green. Your phone will be taken by vigilance people, and it won’t be returned easily.
Return your library book within the allotted time. Otherwise, you’ll have to pay a fine.
A minimum of 75% attendance is required to appear in the semester exam. But even if you have around 50% attendance, you can appear in the exam after paying a fine.
Students usually don’t take the rules seriously. However, I would recommend you follow these basic rules to not get into any trouble."

36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",Which is a better university: GITAM or Vignan?,"Among GITAM and Vignan, the former is a better option. GITAM is far better than any private college in Andhra Pradesh. The course fee is high but the quality of education and the culture on campus make up for it. Along with theoretical knowledge, you will get to learn the practical aspects of each subject. 
The placement record for the institute is great. In 2021, the highest CTC offered in the placement drive was 19 LPA. 
If you are interested in CSE and have a flair for coding then GITAM will be the better option."
36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",Is Vignan University a good school?,"My sister studied at Vignan University. It was not the best experience for my sister but it may be different for you.
Vignan University has a high course fee. For a 4-year long B.Tech, you will have to pay around 9 lakhs in total. The university charges nearly 2 lakhs per annum without hostel accommodations. 
The faculty base is good. Most of the faculty are graduates from NIT or IIT. 
Placement record of the institute is not that great. From my sister’s batch, only 400 students out of 1200 got placements. The remaining 66% graduated without any placement offers. 
The environment of the institute is not that good. There is caste-based politics on campus. If you have other better options, then you should go for them, instead of VIgnana University."
36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",How is Vignan University for computer science?,"Hearing about Vignan University from one of my friends. I can say that his overall experience there was not that good. Here are some of the reasons why:
The students aren’t treated well and caste discrimination is everywhere around the campus. 
Many students have witnessed that the chairman of the college himself is into such practices. 
There are strict rules that have to be followed by the students. 
If the students fail to attend the class during the study hours, their attendance will be cut without any prior notice. 
No extracurricular activities take place in the college.
Sometimes students get indulged in bad habits such as gamblings. 
The college will keep on charging high amounts in the form of fees and they charge different amounts from different students. 
The placement opportunities are also not good.
Thus, it is advised that don’t choose this college as it will only waste your valuable time and money. Keep looking at other colleges which are better than Vignan University."
36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",Is there any dress code for girls in Vignan University Guntur AP?,"There is a uniform code for not only girls but also for boys. It is compulsory to wear and the college has some spare days when you are allowed to wear casuals i.e. Wednesdays and Saturdays. 
Boys can wear t-shirts with polo collars as round neck t-shirts are prohibited. For girls, Indian wear is a must and should be followed. 
Moreover, the students of final year aren’t restricted with the dress codes, they can wear casuals every day."
36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",How was Vignan University?,"Some of my friends are students at Vignan University. According to them, it was quite satisfying, the overall performance of this institute. They mentioned some facts about the college, which might give you a clear idea about it.
The main attraction of colleges is their infrastructure, as it is quite good. 
Moreover, the seminar halls are well constructed and the hostels are well maintained and hygienic. 
This university enrolls the students in both Management and Technical courses. 
Moreover, the timings of both the programs are different. 
The college for both the programs begins at the same time i.e. 8 AM. 
For the students of management, their classes end at 1 PM and for B.Tech students, the classes end at around 3:30 PM.
The lecturers are also quite cooperative and are good to the students. Also, they are available for students at least 3 to 4 times a week. 
Moreover, the students aren’t restricted to do anything outside the classroom, they are free to sit on the campus near the beautiful nature. 
The most appreciated thing in hostels is the mess, the food is so delicious than any other colleges’ mess. 
The food quality and quantity is really good, like the IITs. The food definitely won't disappoint you.

36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",Is Vignan better than VVIT?,"Vignan University, by all means, is better than VVIT. Here are some of the reasons why. 
The faculty of the institute is cooperative. There are also upgraded lab amenities and research facilities. 
The hostels are well maintained with the provision of hygienic food facilities. 
The library, generally called Dr. Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao Library, has good collections of significant books. 
The campus has good sports facilities. The admin blocks are well kept, with centralized air conditioning and upgraded lab facilities.

Hence, Vignan is definitely several steps ahead of VVIT."
36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",How many marks are required to get a seat in Vignan University?,"One of my brothers had appeared for the examination at Vignan University. Here are some things I got to know from him about the marks required to get a seat at Vignan University.
To get admission at Vignan University, you must have at least 60% marks in the V-SAT/EAMCET/JEE. However it will only ensure a seat in the college, but not the preferred branch. 
As at this percentage, you will face limitations to choose their preferred branch. 
If you score good then the university may offer you the most popular and in-demand branch i.e. ECE and CSE. 
If the marks are less, then the seats may be provided to the higher scorer which in result makes your stream choice limited. 
Thus, if you want your choice of branch, then you are supposed to score more marks in V-SAT/EAMCET/JEE. 
Once score higher marks then the students can choose their desired branch at the counseling round. 
Furthermore, there are other ways to get your seat for the desired branch and that is the Management quota. The management quota/category-B can help you with getting a preferred branch but it costs more than the normal fees."
36,"Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research",Does Vignan University have a reimbursement option or not?,"It does have a reimbursement option if you have a good EAMCET rank, only then will you be given the opportunity to avail it. My cousin was allowed fee reimbursement. This is how it works:
% of reimbursement JEE Marks EAMCET Rank VSAT Rank
100% Above 175 8000 Below 50
50% Between 134-175 8001-16000 Between 51-100
25% 134 16001-24000 Between 101-125
Also, if you're bright enough and are among the top 5% in your department, then you will be granted an opportunity to avail scholarship from the university as well. Keep yourself updated by checking the official website, to know the changes in fee reimbursement and the scholarship granting Processes."

40,Sona College of Technology,What is your review of Sona College of Technology?,"After a critical analysis of Sona College of Technology, my cousin analyzed the pattern followed by the engineering colleges all over India.
Here is what she has to say about her experience from her time as a student of that college:
It is a private college and she strongly advises looking for other, better options.
The faculty is inexperienced and the faculty is not in touch with what they are imparting.
This college is not the right place for foreign students. The students come through counseling and most of them have never heard about IITs or the AIEEE and/or JEE exams. Their IQ is low.
The college system is absolutely horrible. They do not care about your interests or goals.
If you are a foreign student, then go for NITs and/or II(I)Ts. Or you can opt for studying in some country or stay back in your native country.
Most of the teaching staff as well the non-teaching staff verbally abuses the students and more often than not in public.
Despite the college having a good reputation when it comes to providing opportunities, there are a lot of drawbacks.
The faculty demands to be ‘respected’. Some of the teachers pry into the personal lives of their students and use that against them. The staff uses unfair scrutiny while signing records and attendances. They unfairly judge the students and belittle them thus, denting their self-esteem. Partiality is rampant in this institute. No wonder my acquaintance had such a traumatic experience in college."
40,Sona College of Technology,How are the placements of Sona College of Technology?,"According to one of my friends who graduated from Sona College of Technology in the year 2016, the placement reports for the final year students have not been great for his batch.

Here are the recent placement highlights of the institute.

41,Jain University - [JU],How is Jain University Bangalore?,Jain University isn’t a good option for pursuing a degree. The management isn’t cooperative. Faculty members are not experienced. Most faculty members have just completed their graduation and don’t have any experience at all. They also charge huge course fees. A B.Tech degree from Jain will cost around INR 6.6 lakhs. The college fee isn’t worth the facilities that you will get.
41,Jain University - [JU],What is your review of Jain University?,"None of the branches of Jain University offer good academics. The faculty base is average at best. The management of the university isn’t cooperative. The curriculum isn’t challenging. The learning process is mostly theoretical. You won’t get much practical exposure. 
Usually, mass recruiters visit the campus placement. According to the placement highlights, the average CTC offered is around INR 4.96 LPA."
41,Jain University - [JU],"What are the reviews on Jain University, Bangalore? How are the placements (especially for a B.Tech)?","When it comes to life at Jain University, you should be aware of the following benefits and drawbacks:
Pros:
Infrastructure:
It has world-class infrastructure, particularly in terms of sporting facilities. It is the only college in India with a golf course on its campus. The grounds for cricket, football, and hockey are fantastic.
Hostels:
This is the most exciting part. Real life can be found in the Jain University Hostel. In terms of facilities, it is one of the best in India. Sodexo is in charge of the mess. You can use all the facilities if you live in a hostel. 
Placements: 
According to the most recent report, the highest and average packages offered during Jain University placements in 2022 were INR 30 LPA and INR 6.92 LPA, respectively.

Cons:
The pedagogy is the same as at VTU. There isn't much progress.
It is still in the early stages. As a result, almost everything will be unpredictable, including placements and course structure. It still needs to prove its worth.
The faculty is below average. With the exception of a few, everyone is so young in teaching. There is no Professor at all, only Associate Professors.
It is lacking the industry interface.
There isn't as much of a crowd as one might anticipate from Bangalore.
In conclusion, it is a Mediocre College. One can choose the CS branch if they do not have access to a college and spend their four years there with the goal of receiving a job offer from an IT company in the end."
41,Jain University - [JU],Which is the better Jain University/Christ University?,"A friend of mine who studies at Jain University says the faculty is decent but if you are mainly looking for placements, there is no guarantee. There are quite a few IT jobs available but since Bangalore is the Silicon City of the country, you will probably not get placements in core areas.
From what information was shared with me, the hostel fees and tuition fees are also quite high. Plus, admission to the university is also given directly by filling up the application form or you can even give the COMEDK, KCET exam or contact the college directly.
Infrastructure-wise, the college is definitely good with five-star facilities in your hostel rooms and Bangalore city to explore. But, you have to pay for almost everything.
You will see a diverse crowd in the college including a few Africans too. However, you will probably not be able to gain industry-relevant skills that might help boost your career. Overall, it is an okay university."
42,Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology - [CBIT],"Which is a better college for CS, JNTUH or CBIT?","A close friend of mine is currently pursuing an integrated program at JNTU and is not at all pleased with its standard of education. He stated a few points that clarified his stance further
Majority of the subjects are taught by lecturers and not the actual professors. They have no interest in teaching and teach only a handful of subjects and leave the rest to untrained and underqualified lecturers.
Introduction of new courses like IDP, IDDMP, IIDDMP is greatly affecting the quality of education. The high batch size affects the student-teacher ratio and the limited resources cannot be availed by everyone.
JNTU  5-year course placements are very poor. CBIT has better companies than JNTU that offer better packages and opportunities.
JNTU has a better location than CBIT which is in a remote location and has limited outside life. 
JNTU has no transport facilities so this might be a major obstacle throughout your program.
In all, I would suggest you go for CBIT as it seems to be in a better position than JNTU both in terms of placements as well as quality of education."
42,Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology - [CBIT],I have a choice of joining JNTUH or CBIT this year. I can also repeat to go for the NIT or BITS the next year. What should I do now?,"I don't know much about CBIT and Hindustan University. But I won’t recommend you the NCR campus of SRM.
It is in fact not located in the National Capital Region. It is situated in Modinagar (Sikrikalan to be precise).The management of this college is very poor. You’ll be wasting a lot of energy for simple requests like getting statements attested, acquiring a recommendation letter, getting fee refunds, etc.
I studied CSE over there. The faculty for CSE is considered to be the best. However, in reality, most teachers don’t even have an idea of their specialization. You’ll find that the same teacher is taking classes for various specializations like Data Structures, Mobile Computing, Theory of Computation, Compiler, etc. New ideas aren’t encouraged in the classroom. 
The hardware in CSE labs is top notch, but the software is all outdated. The hostels are decent but the mess food is disappointing. The hostel wardens do minimum to maintain discipline. For placements, you’ll have to travel all the way to Chennai, with no support from the management, and no accommodation facilities. 
Thus, do not choose the NCR campus of SRM University, especially for the CSE program."
43,New Horizon College of Engineering - [NHCE],"Which college is better, New Horizon College of Engineering or Dayananda Sagar Academy of Technology and Management (DSATM)?","One of my friends suggested that CSE placements in this college are much better than other branches. Other branches like ECE and EEE struggle a lot to get good companies which CSE students get at one go. 
The campus drive is conducted one year after passing out from the college. Many cores, noncore and BPO companies come here for placements. Good packages are offered to the students. Some of the companies also have a bond of 2 to 3 years.

44,Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute - [VJTI],What would be the best option between VJTI (Bombay) CS & IIITM Gwalior IT + an MBA/MTech?,"You may have confused SPIT (Sardar Patel Institute of Technology) with SPCE (Sardar Patel College of Engineering). SPIT is not an autonomous institute. The courses offered in SPIT are Computers, IT, Electronics, and Electronics and Telecom.
Deciding Factors:
If you are looking for any particular program, then you should narrow down your choice of college based on courses. If you are more college-driven then you should go through the following points to make the right decision.
First, you should ask yourself about what do you want out of your engineering degree, whether it is academics, extracurricular, or co-curricular. 
Also, it depends on your future goals. Whether you want good placements, seek higher education, or go for start-ups. 
VJTI:
Considering all the factors, VJTI is the best option.
It is an autonomous college with a strong foundation. It also has a broad alumni base. 
All these factors result in better internship opportunities, better placing companies, and a better network in education. 
For extracurriculars, most of the engineering colleges in Mumbai offer almost the same opportunities. However, Thandomal, DJSCOE, and RAIT offer mesmerizing events. However, since extracurricular is not the sole factor of consideration, VJTI will be sufficient. 
The placement statistics of recent years at VJTI are as follows.
Average CTC
6.8 LPA
Highest CTC
27 LPA
Academics and co-curricular do not depend on the institute only. It is what you make of it. VJTI is the best choice as it provides a good network and exposure.
Preference Order:
The preference order of the institutes other than VJTI is as follows. 
Placement- SPIT>DJSCOE>KJSCOE
Reputation- SPIT>KJSCOE>DJSCOE
Academics- SPIT>DJSCOE>KJSCOE
Alumni- DJSCOE>KJSCOE>SPIT
Extracurricular- DJSCOE>SPIT>KJSCOE
If you get admission to VJTI you should definitely opt for it. You should consider what course you are choosing and research about the facilities and placements. For example, CS at SPIT has better placement than ME at VJTI or any of the other colleges mentioned here. 
Also, autonomous colleges have better administration in MU. They have a better examination schedule, quick result release and you will have higher chances of securing a good CGPA."
44,Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute - [VJTI],"If I am interested in mechanical engineering, which is better, COEP, the College of Engineering Pune, or VJTI in Mumbai, and are they both comparable to VNIT in Nagpur?","Comparing the mechanical branches of SPCE and VJTI, VJTI is the definite winner among the two, considering almost all factors like branding, faculty, peers, placement, etc. Mechanical Engineering is one of the best branches of VJTI.
The points below give a brief overview of VJTI and state several reasons supporting the choice.
The brand name of VJTI is much more reputed than SPCE and is considered to be a badge for engineering aspirants. VJTI is much more known to foreign universities and institutes than SPCE.
The average IQ of students from VJTI is much more than that of SPCE, as evident from students’ reviews of the two institutes. Most likely, students in SPCE have a lower thinking ability than that of VJIT.
In VJTI, there are clubs namely SAE, Inferno, SRA engaged in a lot of technical, cultural, and social interactive activities among students.
Mechanical Engineering of VJIT has some of the best teachers in the institute. Some of them, for example, Dr. Tendolkar, Dr. Deshpande, Dr. Kulkarni, etc, have exceptional skills in teaching their respective fields.
In VJTI, there are very few teachers who are not quite good. But, in SPCE, the mechanical engineering branch actually lacks a sufficient number of good teachers, some of whose lectures are sometimes confusing.
As usual, VJTI tops in terms of placement of the two institutes by a high margin. Most companies offering jobs in Mechanical Engineering at VJTI offer excellent packages to students. In SPCE Mechanical Engineering, the placement scenario is average, with a lesser overall placement percentage.
Therefore, SPCE is in no way comparable to VJTI, the latter being a much better institute in terms of all considerable factors."

The autonomous status of the college allows it to have a better curriculum as compared to Mumbai University and makes it comparable to the curriculum of the likes of VJTI. Some of the advantages that you might experience here are:
The length of these papers is around 100 marks, in general as compared to the exams of MU which are 80 marks. The exam structure is very hectic. Sometimes, the students get only one-week of preparatory leave. The students get a gap of just one or two days between two exams. The faculty members are good but they aren’t able to complete the syllabus on time.
Being a Gujrati minority college, it is an all-vegetarian campus (This might be a disadvantage only if you are a non-vegetarian.

49,Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management and Engineering - [MPSTME],Is it worth it to go to NMIMS Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management (MPSTME) by shelling 14 lacs?,"The important thing is your choice and interest. If you are not interested in the subject, you will face difficulty completing the course. Being an IT student I am a little biased about the field.
Keep in mind that premier universities such as IITs and BITS lack IT. This is due to the fact that IT is not a legitimate branch. It was exclusively created to meet the industry’s needs.
Consider a CS engineer as an auto engineer and an IT engineer as a mechanic or a driver. It is, in fact, a very well-paid job, but that is all there is to it.
You'll be hired by organizations that specialize in maintenance and software development.
Any research or new innovations in the realm of computers are almost always carried out by CS or ECE engineers.
IT is mostly concerned with computers and software. CSE, on the other hand, is a discipline of mathematics with a concentration on computing.
In IT, you have to concentrate on software rather than the backend whereas in CSE you will learn more about computers and applied mathematics.
When it comes to job placements, both streams have good placement records. Due to their huge demand in the growing corporate industry, there will always be the requirement for IT professionals.
Thus, there are some differences between IT and CSE. Some subjects are similar, some faculty members are also the same. They are approached by the same companies like Accenture, Cognizant, TCS, IBM, Tech Mahindra, Morgan Stanley, Mindtree, Capgemini, HCL, HP, Dell, Wipro, Infosys, etc."

The college has a legacy of its own. It is backed by politician Banwarilal Purohit, so it does not face any issues related to funding. 
RCOEM was in a good position earlier. But now, the senior faculties have taken administrative roles, and seldom care about their lectures. The new faculty, on the other hand, lacks experience and knowledge. Some of the faculty members mistreat freshers and punish them for the smallest of mistakes. 
Most of the college placements are in IT support roles, which are worthless in the long run. The T&P department scares the students about remaining jobless if they do not get placed in IT companies. The best way to become job ready at SRCOE is to join online courses and enhance one’s skill set on our own. The college fests aren’t good. The students mainly participate in them to make up for their poor academic performance.

These are said to be rumors spread by rival institutions. Let me share some of the facts which might clear your views regarding the institution. 
The placements are not affected as notable companies keep on visiting the campus. SJCE has maintained a good relationship with the companies
The institute sets its own syllabus, which is industry-oriented unlike that of VTU which is not usually updated.
SJCE is known for its brand, the name is not removed from the degrees and is often mentioned by recruiters in India and abroad.
The degree programs are accredited by NBA and the degree awarded by the University is recognized by countries that have signed the Washington accord. So, while applying for PG in other countries, your degree has its value.
It follows the OBE system and has 5 events per subject which are similar to the model followed by foreign universities, unlike VTU who still follows the age-old internals concept.
It is suggested that you do not go by rumors spread by rival institutions. You can definitely put your trust in SJCE, as it stands strong as one of the notable educational institutions in Karnataka."

College Ranking: SJCE is considered among the top 5 private colleges in Karnataka. The ranking seems to improve every year.
Study Environment: Being located in Mysore, it is comparatively cleaner and more peaceful for an educational institution.
Student Crowd: Many top-ranking students of KCET and COMEDK get admission here, which develops a healthy competition among the students.  
Faculty: The faculty members are highly experienced and very supportive of their students.
Hostel: The rooms are well maintained and very clean. Even the food served at the hostel is healthy and hygienic. 
Library: It provides a huge collection of books and other reading materials. It can feel a bit strict as if you fail to return a book after 15 days, a late fine is charged.
Extracurricular Activities: There are many clubs for dancing, singing, and drama and technical clubs like LCC, CSI, and IEEE. The sports club is also very active. They bag many prizes at the state level and regional level every year.

The placements are good. But, your chances of getting placed during the campus recruitment drive are higher in CBIT or Vasavi. At CVR, you can apply for placements only if you choose for higher studies.
CVR is too much to handle. The institute runs behind “professionalism” which is merely scoring higher marks, 100% attendance, submitting formal papers which actually contain plagiarized content; all copied from the internet, wearing formals to the labs, and all such things.
You will have no time for yourself. You will always be occupied by some assignment or some record or to finish something up quickly because of the approaching deadline. But, it will certainly get you something, either mark, or attendance, or fines!

66,"Institute of Technology, Nirma University","What is the expected cutoff for the Institute of Technology, Nirma University?","My cousin completed his B.Tech from Nirma Institute of Technology who stayed in the community hostel named Saurashtra Kadva Patel Samaj situated in Gandhinagar. However, he had friends from various hostels, and here is his insight about the hostels.
Hiramani: This is the most liberal hostel for students in terms of rules and timings. You can return late at night and can indulge in typical hostelling activities like playing LAN games, watching movies on the laptop, etc, as long as you aren’t disturbing others. However, many students complain about the bad quality of mess food.
SGVP: It is a gurukul of Swaminarayan, thus making it quite religious and strict in terms of rules and decorum. Honestly, if you belong to a religion other than Hinduism then you might feel uncomfortable at times. However, the food quality is one of the best as they provide really healthy and tasty breakfast, lunch and dinner. The biggest drawback of this hostel is that there are no doors in the room hence no privacy at all.
Also, check out the following restrictions you have to face if you live in SGVP.
You have to wake up by 6:30, take a bath, do Pooja and assemble for prayer in the evening and return to the hostel before 10:00 pm.
You are not allowed to make noise by playing loud games.
You can not watch any objectionable things on your laptop, because the rector can barge into the room at any time.
If you break any rule you will have to pay a fine.
Saurashtra Kadva Patel Samaj: Here, my cousin chose to live for 2 years out of his B.Tech journey. The hostel was neat and clean and fees were just 20000 for a year, however, the food was just satisfactory.
Overall, it is highly recommended for freshers to join SGVP because of cleanliness, great food, and discipline. But, if you have budget constraints, the fees might seem high. Nevertheless, it is worth the fees."
66,"Institute of Technology, Nirma University",What are the best hostels to stay for the students who study at NIRMA Institute of Technology?,"I have a friend who is doing his B.Tech from Nirma University and have a better idea about the selection process and cut-off. Here is what he had to say.
According to him, with merit of above 2000, you will need to wait for the spot round, i.e. the end of the admission process. You would receive an email from the authorities in the college asking you to attend the counseling session they would organize for freshers.
Going by the recent trend of cutoff, you will probably get electronics, civils, chemical, or even instrumentation branches in the spot round. Getting into Chemical or other branches will be tough with this rank. It will be difficult to get Electronics with this course also, given the rising demand of the branch."
67,Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology - [SLIET],How is Sant Longowal Institute Of Engineering & Technology?,"The Sant Longowal Institute Of Engineering & Technology is an autonomous institution situated in Longowal, a small town in the district of Sangrur in Punjab. I have a known relative who is an alumnus of the institute. The following points are based on his experiences:
Pros
The infrastructure of the institute is spread over 450 acres.
The semester fee for a bachelor of engineering is 26,000 INR.
The campus has a playground as well as a stadium.
The ME and CSE department are renowned and the faculty is alumni of foreign universities and institutes like IITs.
It has scientifically oriented clubs like Endeavour for Robotics and Aeromodelling which take part in SAEINDIA Aero design Challenge, Junkyard warriors. They participate in SAEINDIA Baja competition and Juggernauts participate in F7 racing. The teams have achieved commendable results.
You will have a lot of time to prepare for GATE, IES, CDS, Civil Services, etc.
Placement for mechanical and computer science is ever-improving in this institute.
There are cons as well. The institute is situated in a remote area and it would be difficult for you to get coaching classes for GATE and other competitive exams. 
The facilities provided by the institute leave a lot to be desired and so does the management which you will see in every technical institute funded by the government."
67,Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology - [SLIET],How is Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology? How are the campus and the placements?,"My brother graduated in B.Tech (CS) from Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology. I have heard about the advantages and disadvantages of enrolling in SLIET.
Campus:-
  The campus is moderately large with 448 acres.
Fully furnished labs, well-maintained furniture, and a huge library with a good collection of books and journals, and research papers. 
It has 13 clean hostels with a very good connection of high-speed LAN. It has sports facilities, medical services, a temple, a Gurudwara, ATM, banks, a shopping complex, and student activity centers.
One huge stadium to play multiple sports such as cricket, football, etc, a swimming pool, one beautiful lake, and two ponds, a hygienic canteen, and a restaurant with multiple eating joints.
Placements:-
If you spend your four years in this university, it wouldn’t be a waste of your money. Earlier, the placement of this college wasn’t good enough but last year a total of 41 companies visited the university and 195 students got placed in the best companies. Due to COVID, the placement is still in progress.
The top recruiters who came to the university in 2020 were Cognizant, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Nestle India, Capgemini, Softstar, Nature Bio Food, TCS, Ralson, Godrej, and many more. 
Thus, the University keeps academics on priority and fun at the same time."
67,Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology - [SLIET],Which is better: Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology or Thapar University?,"My brother was a student of the Electrical Engineering 2019 batch, so I can tell you about it.
In terms of academics, it is really a good Institute with world-class faculty members in their fields. They will assist you greatly even if your problem is not academic in nature, despite the fact that some teachers' teaching methods are deplorable.
You don't have to be concerned about maintaining a decent CGPA. You'll be able to easily crack competitive exams like GATE, IES, or even get a good placement (many Gold medalists are unable to clear the GATE cut-off). Focus on skills and knowledge rather than CGPA (but at least you should have 8).
One more important point to consider that if you are planning to enroll in any core branch, I strongly advise you to begin preparing for GATE, IES, UPSC, CAT, or any competitive exam in your first year or as soon as possible, rather than coding or programming. You will have plenty of time to study for all of these. It will really help you in the future."

71,Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology - [NMIT],What is your review of Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology?,"Without any doubt, Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology has several attributes that work in its favor. It is the youngest institution to gain autonomy that is situated 25 km away from the city and there is no traffic during early mornings. Many buses from the college help students and staff for commuting but having your own vehicle would be much better.
Academics:
There are various branches of engineering that are preferred like computer science, electronics and communication, information technology, and mechanical. These four branches have their reputation in the college but computer science is considered best.
Faculty:
The faculty is well-qualified and delivers various programming languages to the students very accurately, which is one of the most important parts if you are pursuing computer science. They have friendly behavior towards students, and easily give marks to them. If you focus on studies regularly then you will be able to score good grades in your exams.
Placements:
If you are an average student with a decent grade of 8-10 then you can secure placement offer in service-based companies. If you have good programming knowledge then you can expect to be selected in product-based companies. But they usually offer supporting roles. The average CTC offered at the institute is around 3-3.5 LPA.
So overall it is a decent college with good academics and facilities."

72,Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering - [SVCE],No data found,No data found
73,Rajalakshmi Engineering College - [REC],"Which is better, Rajalakshmi or Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering?","In terms of teaching, both Rajalakshmi Engineering College and RMK are good. The faculty is well qualified who are dynamic and many of them are Ph.D holders. REC is good in terms of exposure and extra co-curricular activities, compare to RMK.
RMK has a mess in which you get good non-veg food with desserts along with tea and snacks in the evening. But REC has 3-4 canteens inside and outside which gives you good quality of food but the only negative point is that they don't serve non-veg food.
REC is lenient when compared with RMK in terms of dress code, communicating with your classmates, using phones and laptops. Campus ambiance is good in both REC and RMK. Now the REC campus has been renovated and it has more greenery when compared to past days.
In terms of placement at RMK, you will get several opportunities for IT companies and limited offers for civil and mechanical. REC provides a lot of training programs and ensures that each student gets placed. Some of the recruiters are TATA, WIPRO and the list goes on."
74,PES University - [PESU],What is the average package for students of CSE at PES University?,"According to the NIRF 2020 rankings, RV College was ranked 70th in India. On the other hand, PES University was ranked at the 93rd position. Both of these colleges are having a good placement record. 
The different categories based on which we can compare the two colleges are listed below:
Placements: 
PES University Placement drives offered 1185 job offers last year and placed 605 UG & 31 PG students in reputed companies. The highest CTC of INR 49.75 LPA was offered to one of the B.Tech students. The average salary comes out to be around INR 6 to 6.5 Lakhs per annum for both the UG and PG Students. The top recruiters that visit the campus include:

Wipro
Honeywell
Cognizant
HP
Flipkart
IBM
Nvidia
For RVCE, the highest salary package offered last year was INR 49.75 Lakhs per annum as per the college’s website. 967 offers have been made in the year 2021 and 183 companies have visited the campus as of April 2021. The Companies that visit the campus almost every year include:
PayPal
Flipkart
Infosys
Intel Technology
Intuit
GENPACT
Deltax
Amazon

Adani Group
Faculty: Both the colleges have excellent faculty, so there are no clear winners that can be declared based on this parameter. The Teachers are highly qualified in their respective fields.
Syllabus: PES University has a more relevant syllabus than RVCE but the professors' methodology to teach at PES University is not satisfactory. RVCE has a modern syllabus for core branches, but it still lags compared to other top colleges in the country.
Students: After considering and analyzing the CET cutoffs and enrollment data we can conclude that RVCE is the choice of the majority of the toppers. 
Campus: RVCE has a larger campus as compared to PES University but the campus of PES University is better maintained. 
RVCE College can be said to be No.1 but choosing PES University can not be considered a bad choice. You should try and consider other factors as well before making the final decision. You can choose either of the two colleges and can still make it big in life."
74,PES University - [PESU],What is the average package of CSE students at PES university?,"The PES University CSE branch is a popular choice among students who wish to pursue a career in the field of computer science and engineering. However, whether it is worth paying 3 lakh/annum through the PESSAT depends on several factors, including your personal goals, financial situation, and career aspirations. Here are some points to consider:
Quality of education: PES University is known for its academic excellence and has been consistently ranked among the top private universities in India. The CSE program is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in theoretical and practical aspects of computer science and engineering, and the faculty members are reputed in their respective fields. If you are looking for a high-quality education that can prepare you for a career in the IT sector, PES University could be a good choice.
Placement prospects: Another important factor to consider is the placement record of the university. PES University has tie-ups with several reputed companies in the IT industry, and the CSE branch has a good track record of placements. If you perform well in the program and maintain a decent CGPA, you can expect to land a job in a reputed company with a decent package. However, it's important to note that placement opportunities are not guaranteed, and your own skills and efforts play a crucial role in securing a job.
Cost: The cost of education is an important consideration for many students and their families. PES University charges a fee of 3 lakh/annum for the CSE program through the PESSAT, which can be a significant financial burden for some. If you have other options that are more affordable and offer similar quality of education and placement prospects, you may want to consider them as well. However, if you are convinced that PES University is the best option for you and you can afford the fees, then it could be worth the investment.
Scholarships and financial aid: PES University offers scholarships and financial aid to meritorious and deserving students. If you have a good academic record or are from an economically weaker section, you may be eligible for financial assistance that can reduce the cost of education. It's worth exploring these options to see if you can reduce the financial burden.
In conclusion, whether the PES University CSE branch is worth paying 3 lakh/annum through the PESSAT depends on your individual circumstances and priorities. If you value high-quality education and good placement prospects and can afford the fees, PES University could be a good choice. However, if you have other options that are more affordable or offer better value for money, you may want to consider them as well."
74,PES University - [PESU],Is PES University No.1 or RVCE?,"My brother studied in this institute, so I might be able to help you with the question. Let me discuss how his first year went. 
Honestly, at first, you do feel that your first semester is tougher than other colleges. 
The faculty is good and very friendly and cooperative. 
The marking scheme, the assignments, and the volume of study, plus the skewed branch-wise ratio can result in excessive peer pressure. 
But once you've figured out how the system works it will be easier to manage.
Furthermore, from ex-students and present students, you will get to know both sides of the coin. You can then compare both of their experiences. You will get to know what changed and how tougher the first year became from before. 
Other than your dedicated departmental subjects. Both physics and chemistry are also equally difficult. They require some surreal level of effort to achieve a good GPA. You just have to stay focused and concentrate on your studies. It is easier to improve your GPA in the first year."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],Which is better: IEM or Heritage Institute of Technology?,"I have a few friends from Heritage Institute of Technology and here is their insight on the management quota admission at the institute. 
According to them, for IT, the management quota fee goes up to 12 lakhs. If you have a decent academic record you can bargain to bring it down to 10-11 lakhs. For ECE, the fees go up to 16 lakhs. 
However, before taking admission at Heritage through management quota you should know that you will not be missing out much if you choose to go to other colleges affiliated with MAKAUT. You will have almost similar placement opportunities and exposure."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],How much donation is needed to get B.Tech admission in Heritage Institute of Technology through management quota?,"Heritage Institute of Technology (HIT) is one of the best engineering colleges among all the affiliated colleges with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology. The courses have NAAC and NBA accreditation and are AICTE approved. It is also recognized among the national engineering institutes with 154th NIRF Ranking for Engineering 2020.
The institute witnessed a 100% placement record during the last few years. Most of the students have bagged packages from more than one company. The CSE, ECE, and IT branches have an edge over the other branches in the institute.
The placements statistics (overall) are below:
Placement Percentage 80-90%
Average Package 8-10 LPA
Lowest Package INR 3-4 LPA
Highest Package INR 16-20 LPA
Recruiting Companies Wipro, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Cognizant, etc.
Usually, grabbing the package in a broader bracket is a cumbersome task. Overall, HIT is the best among all the colleges of any other WBUT."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],What is the placement scenario of Heritage Institute of Technology graduates?,"Taking donation money depends on how many seats are available. The donation fee will be high for the streams that have a lot of demand.
However, if there are seats that are vacant, you can try spot counseling and you will not be charged at all for this except for the fee required for admission.
The money that you might be asked to pay can vary depending on the financial situation of the candidates. Getting in touch with the management facility will help you in getting a clear idea. Keep in mind, however, that people who opted for the management quota had to pay huge amounts of money.
Almost 10% of the seats were kept aside for management quota candidates and they are given on the basis of ‘first come first’. Some people got admitted without paying anything at all except for the admission fee and some had to pay huge amounts of money to get in.
Another thing about getting admission through quota is you may lag behind your peers. Even if you do get admission, a lot depends on you as well."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],If I want to go into Techno India or the Heritage Institute of Technology of West Bengal through the management quota then how much money may I be asked to pay?,"The Placements cell coordinates with various industries and organizations for placements and internships of students. High numbers of students placed in companies like TCS (Tata consultancy services) and Infosys. These companies are mass recruiters for Heritage institute of technology. Placements statics of Heritage institute of technology are:
TCS, Wipro, star cements and Omics international are major recruiters, 371 out of 450 students placed in these companies in the year 2018.
Other recruiters are BYJU’s learning app, Extra Mark Education India Pvt. Ltd, Young optics, Tega industries, skipper limited and Careers Coms HR services.
Highest package offered in the institute is 16 Lakhs per annum by Microsoft in the year 2014.
Students have been placed in 55 plus companies in campus interviews.
Average placement of the HIT is between 3 to 4 lakhs per annum every year.
More than 70% of students placed in TCS in mass recruitment every year.
Maximum of students placed every year, so HIT have nearly 100% placements.
Except for placements, students of HIT also take part in summer internships and mock interviews sessions for each branch. The institute also signed a MOU with New Jersey institute of technology (NJIT) for students exchange program. There is also one ED–cell (Entrepreneurship development cell) in the institute for providing a platform to young entrepreneurs. So if the academics report is at least 6.75 one will get placed in companies."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],Which is better: KIIT University or Heritage Institute of Technology?,"Both the Heritage Institute of Technology and BP Poddar Institute of Management and Technology are technical colleges affiliated to the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT), West Bengal.

Pros
Heritage Institute of Technology 
Huge campus, serene environment, great infrastructure, great area for hangouts
Good faculty and plenty of options to choose your specialization
Good placements. There is a high probability that you will end up in TCS
BP Poddar Institute of Management and Technology
Situated closer to the airport and has multiple transportation options
Haldiram’s, Eco Park, CC2, and many other outdoor options are present
Placements are decent and many companies such as EY, Bosch visit here for campus placements
Ragging is completely absent with some minor “intro” or some small tasks
Cons
Heritage Institute of Technology
The location is the biggest problem as you will not find any public transport nearby. You will have to walk miles to get a small cigarette shop. And forget about dining options and restaurants nearby.
BP Poddar Institute of Management and Technology
The faculty are decent but you will need the help of lab assistants more often than the professors
Fests and other celebrations are not as prevalent as other campuses
The canteen is very small
Infrastructure is very limited with no playground, no auditorium, and no grand construction
Uniform is compulsory
Both are equally good colleges and ultimately you will be getting the certificate from the same university with almost the same level of teaching. You will get around a 15% chance of getting a job in a core sector company. So decide for yourself what you want looking at the pros and cons of both the colleges."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],What is the average salary offered during placement at heritage institute of technology?,"Being one of the oldest engineering colleges in India, IIEST Shibpur is known for its legendary status, well-equipped campus, and a thorough specialization across more than 48 courses. HITK on the other hand is a private autonomous college with a Grade B++ NAAC Accreditation, approved by AICTE, and offers 25 programs across 2 streams.
We can compare the two institutions based on the following factors:
Ranking: IIEST Shibpur is ranked at 19 by NIRF under engineering institutes in India whereas HITK Kolkata has been ranked at the 150th position by NIRF under the same category.

It sees top companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Deloitte, and more for recruitments. HITK offers an average median salary of 3.4 LPA and does not see many core companies for recruitments. Some of the top companies for placements are TCS, Apollo Paints, HDFC Bank, and IBM.
Based on ranking, campus and placement services students who are looking to join an undergraduate or graduate degree program in Engineering can make their choice accordingly. Both the colleges offer detailed course modules but if your JEE scores are good, it will be comparatively better to opt for IIEST Shibpur."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],"Which is better, Heritage Institute of Technology or BP Poddar Institute of Management and Technology?","Heritage is a very good institute if pursuing CSE is your goal. If we talk about the ranking of the private institutes in West Bengal, then IEM (Institute of Engineering and Management) is the best in the state, followed by Heritage Institute of Technology. Techno India Salt Lake is third in the ranking.
Heritage Institute of Technology will give you a lot of opportunities. 
The coders in the institute can compete with some of the best in the country.

Average CTC 16 LPA
The companies that visit the institute are Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, Capgemini, Oracle, etc. TCS is the biggest recruiter of students graduating from Heritage."
75,Heritage Institute of Technology - [HIT],Which is better HITK Kolkata or IIEST Shibpur?,"The fee structure for B.Tech students of Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata is given below for your reference.
Tuition fee (per semester) – INR 44,000 (1st and 2nd semester), INR 45,100 (3rd and 4th semester), INR 46,200 (5th and 6th semester), and INR 47,300 (7th and 8th semester)
Admission fee (one-time fee) – INR 5,000
Library fee (one-time fee) – INR 6,000
Students’ welfare and sports & games fee (one-time fee) – INR 4,000
Caution deposit (one-time fee and refundable) – INR 10,000
University students’ development fee (INR 500 paid yearly to MAKAUT) – INR 2,200 (one-time fee)
Admission kit (one-time fee) – INR 1,000
Thus the total fee amounts to INR 72,200 when you take admission. Since you would have paid INR 20,000 during counseling, you need to pay an additional amount of INR 52,200 after taking the admission. There is a tuition fee waiver scheme implemented by the college according to which you need not pay the tuition fee.

78,BV Raju Institute of Technology - [BVRIT],Should I prefer GRIET or BVRIT?,"BVRIT (BVRIT Hyderabad College of Engineering for Women) is clearly better than GRIET for CSE students. There is not any significant difference between the two in terms of teaching and pedagogy as the syllabus is more or less the same for every technical college in the Hyderabad region.
The number of students in a typical CSE branch is way much more than that of IT in BVRIT. The faculty are also top-notch and know what they are teaching very well. Yes, of course, there might some very orthodox and traditional teachers who might not inspire students and do not adapt according to the changing market conditions, but these types of professors are lower in number here.
In the end, more than the college, it is your own self-determination that will make you a successful person. A facility with good internet connectivity, self-learning, and competitive coding culture is all you need to succeed at any of the two colleges."

79,University of Petroleum and Energy Studies - [UPES],Is it worthwhile doing an MBA in UPES Dehradun?,"Every B-school has its unique strengths and so does UPES Dehradun which is famous for its domain-specific MBA. If you are willing to pursue an MBA in oil and gas, power management, or energy trading, choosing UPES Dehradun will be the right decision. It offers a plethora of opportunities in these domains and the ROI is also great. There are some industry-specific courses too but their placements are just average.
The best part about UPES is the diversity of the crowd. You will get the chance to interact with people from various backgrounds such as law, management, engineering, and design thus enhancing the learning experience manifolds. 
Ultimately, I will suggest you go for UPES Dehradun only if you are planning to pursue a domain-specific MBA, else you can go for better B Schools."
80,Vardhaman College of Engineering - [VCE],What is your review of Vardhaman College of Engineering?,"Vardhaman College of Engineering has received a very good rating over time. It comes with good infrastructure and has earned itself a reputation in Hyderabad.
Following are the factors that you should consider before opting for the college:
Branch Ratings: It can be given a good rating for both CSE and IT branches. However, other branches like ECE and EEE have earned an average rating, while Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering have ratings below average.
Amenities (Labs, Hostels, etc.): The computer labs are equipped with every crucial facility. In addition, the campus buildings, hostels, and other amenities are relatively well built. The hostel food is somewhat acceptable as well.
Library: It is well built but the major downside is that it lacks certain important books. Surprisingly, you can put forward requests for specific books as and when required, but they rarely arrive.
Faculty: The faculty of Vardhaman College of Engineering can be mostly rated as “average.” The reason is quite simple. A handful of the faculty members are completely or partially not extremely concerned about the issues students usually face. It can be any professor, let alone the HOD.
Placement: The college often receives offers from various companies, especially companies that are IT-related. It is a major drawback. Students from ECE, EEE, or the Mechanical Engineering department often only get offered job profiles that are commonly IT-related. It can only be good if you are interested in taking up your career in the IT sector.
Sports and Extracurricular Activities: It has a well-equipped cricket ground with a turf pitch. Besides that, it comes with a good football field, basketball court, volleyball court, and certain indoor game amenities.
The disadvantage is that students are usually not allowed to use any of these until it is during the cultural fests. Simultaneously, any extracurricular or co-curricular activity is surprisingly not very encouraging. It's the reason why you cannot take up research projects until extremely necessary."
80,Vardhaman College of Engineering - [VCE],"How do I reach Vardhaman College of Engineering, Hyderabad from Gachibowli?","Initially, students did not receive placement opportunities at Vardhaman College of Engineering. The year 2018 saw 40% of engineers getting placed, comparably higher than 2017 where it stood at 35%.
Cocubes is a decent source if you want to find job opportunities. The institute would rather make you sit for the Cocubes exam. You will have an upside if you score above 550.
Here are the latest placement stats of Vardhaman College of Engineering,
Highest Salary Package INR 12 LPA
Top Recruiting Companies Jaro Education, Synopsys, Deloitte, TCS, DBS Bank
For ECE, the options are varied,
You should prepare for the C-DAC PG Diploma for which you are required to clear the CAT examination.
You should get to do internships and know what are the fields that interest you.
Be thoroughly prepared with your core subjects since they will help you in your interviews.
If possible, publish your research papers.
Hope this helps you know more, wish you all the best!"

83,KLE Technological University,How good is KLE Technological University?,"KLE Technological University is a very popular and reputed university. But like any other university, it also has some advantages and disadvantages. Some of my friends are from this institute, and here’s what they have mentioned about it.
Advantages:
KLE Technological University is an autonomous university so it has an edge over VTU or any other educational body.
The infrastructure is very beautiful and spacious. Life at the college campus is completely enjoyable.
There are also various sports and cultural events held at the campus.
This university focuses more on practical-based learning rather than relying on old-school methods or more bookish learning.
The students are assigned to make projects from the 1st semester itself.
The coding culture of this college is very good and it also has a start-up culture.
New ideas by students are appreciated and encouraged.
There is also a UPSC training block inside the campus. It provides coaching to the students who want to prepare for IAS/IPS exams.
Disadvantages:
This university is located at Hubli, so there will be a lack of opportunities for the students to visit the industrial sites.
Most of the students studying here think that engineering is easy and thus they are not focused on their studies. This affects the competitive environment and makes the students careless.
The seniors are not cooperative.
The placements are mediocre.
Companies that participate in the placement drive are mass recruiters like TCS or IBM. They generally offer students lower packages.
Categories KLE Technological University
Course Fee 2.28 lakh
Highest CTC 14 LPA
Average CTC 7-8 LPA
Hence, KLE Technological University is a mediocre college. If you want to study there it is completely your choice. If you are interested in appearing for UPSC exams you can go for it. Other than that, this college does not really stand out."
83,KLE Technological University,How are the placements for CSE and ECE at BVBCET (KLE Technological University)?,"In KLE Technological University (BVBCET), the hostel facilities are quite good, as evident from most reviews over the internet. There are several options in the types of rooms and accommodation at the institute, with varying fee structures for each.

85,MIT World Peace University - [MIT-WPU],What is the cutoff for MIT Pune and VIT Pune through the JEE Mains?,"MAEER’S MIT is also known as Maharashtra Institute of Technology College of Engineering. Both MAEER’S MIT and MIT Pune fall under the MAEER’S group of Institutions. Both the colleges share the same campus based in Kothrud and as well as the faculty on several occasions.
Eligibility Criteria
Students need to secure at least 80 points in JEE mains to get admission to MITCOE.
Students need to secure a rank of 3k-5k in JEE to secure a seat in MIT Pune.
Students need at least 50% in their 12th.
There are separate examinations for admission in BBA and other departments where students need to score at least 60 points to qualify.
Infrastructure
The infrastructure of both MITCOE and MIT are the same since they share the same campus.
Academics and Faculty
MIT College of Engineering
The faculty in MITCOE is average compared to MIT Pune.
There are more junior professors than senior professors. Teachers are highly-qualified, most have an MTech or Ph.D., and some are pursuing one.
There are two shifts for conducting classes- morning and evening.
MIT Kothrud
The faculty of MIT Kothrud is slightly better than MITCOE with all the professors having a Ph.D. in their respective fields.
They have at least 5-year work experience.
The curriculum for both the universities is decided by MIT World Peace University and is up-to-date.
Placements
MIT has a centralized placement system. MITCOE has a placement percentage of 75-90% with an average salary of 3.5-5 LPA.
Mass recruiters like Wipro, TCS, and Infosys visit the college.
More than 80% of MIT students get placed on an average each year.
More than 700 companies come to place students with an average salary between 5-6LPA.
Overall, there is not much difference between the two colleges when it comes to the quality of education and college experience. However, there is a minute difference in fee structure which is almost negligible. So, students can close their eyes and apply to any of the colleges."
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],Is there any difference between VIT Pune and VIIT Pune?,"Yes, both VIT Pune and VIIT Pune are completely different colleges. Both have been established under the flagship of the prestigious VIT Group of Institutions. VIT and VIIT are a part of the same Management working under different names but are different colleges.
Both the colleges are owned by the Bansilal Ramnath Agarwal charitable trust VIT is its main Campus and is better rested than VIIT. It’s located in Bibwewadi, Pune. VIIT is its secondary campus and is also autonomous. It has been ranked among the top engineering institutes in Pune, MH, but less rated than VIT. It’s located in Kondhwa, Pune.
Obviously, VIT is among the top colleges in Pune and is much better than VIIT, especially in terms of placements. It also offers more exposure through activities like Robotics, Sports, or cultural or technical fest. 
Hope this helps you!"
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],"Which is better, a CSE at VIIT Pune or an ENTC at VIT Pune, considering the future of the branch and the college?","My friend is currently in his final year of CSE in VIT and is also working at IBM, Pune for my semester-long internship. VIT and VIIT have a common Training and Placement Officer who oversees the placements of both colleges. In my opinion, VIT CSE is way better than EnTC in terms of placements. My friends in EnTc who score better than my friend in VIIT CSE are still struggling for decent jobs. VIIT CSE students get offers from companies that visit the campus almost every week. Although VIT allows EnTC students to appear for software jobs, most software companies prefer taking CSE students mainly because they have studied the relevant subjects for 4 years.
Moreover, VIT is autonomous. I would recommend you choose CSE even if the colleges are similar because the CSE curriculum and syllabus will guarantee your entry into the Software or IT industry. Another added advantage is that VIT has a system of compulsory semester-long internships in either of the semesters of the 4th year. Students receive internship offers from big companies that likely get converted into placement offers for CSE. This may not be the case for any other college in the entire Pune. 
My friends in EnTC are now struggling to pursue higher studies or jobs in the Software industry. So go for VIT without any second thoughts."
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],"Out of VIT Pune and Symbiosis Institute of Technology Pune, which should I choose?","There are several parameters to compare the two colleges. Some of these are-
Brand- Symbiosis is a brand in India. Any college under Symbiosis International University automatically gets the tag of a good college. VIT Pune is also a well known brand which was established much before SIT. VIT Pune was established in 1983 while SIT came into existence in 2008.
Placements- VIT Pune has a better placement scenario. As far as SIT is concerned, CS/IT and ENTC have an average placement record. On the other hand, Mechanical and Civil have a low placement rate. But the fact is that Mechanical is facing placement shortage at present.
Crowd- The SIT campus has a diverse crowd. It caters to students from all over India, and NRIs. VIT is mainly preferred by students of Maharashtra and its neighboring states.
Infrastructure- Both the colleges have good classrooms and laboratories.
Faculty- I don’t know much about VIT, but the faculty of SIT is highly qualified.
Campus- The SIT campus is located far from the city, but it is huge and has a scenic view. The campus is beautiful and has all the sports facilities.
Both the colleges are equally good. You may choose any of them on the basis of their location, crowd and other factors."
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],"Which is the best for mechanical engineering, VIIT in Pune, VIT in Pune, or MIT Pune?","VIIT Pune Mechanical Engineering program is a 4-year course and the course fee is around INR 5.96 Lakhs (General). The hostel fee is INR 1.21 Lakhs.
You should not waste your year and get admitted to VIIT Pune for your Mechanical Engineering. VIIT Pune is quite a good college. If you drop a year, you might regret that decision because then you will need to explain your gap to the recruiters during placements.
All the institutions in Pune are similar in terms of facilities. The crowd at VIIT Pune is pretty good. The faculty is average. The placement scenario for Mechanical at VIIT 
Pune is average.
Here are the placement statistics for B.Tech Mechanical Engineering (2022) at VIIT Pune-

88,Narula Institute of Technology - [NIT Agarpara],"How are placements of Narula Institute of Technology, Kolkata?","People think NIT Agarpara is a National Institute of Technology but actually, it is Narula Institute of Technology, a TIER 5 Private Engineering College.
One of my friends got passed out from this college and I would like to share his experience with you.
Getting admission to the institute is not that tough. They do conduct an entrance test but it is quite easy.
He told me that, the faculty of the CS department was quite helpful but can’t say the same about other departments’ faculty. Language can be a barrier if you do not know Bengali.
Further, the placement in CS/IT industry was decent and many got placed including my friend with an approximate initial package of 3 LPA in the service-based industry.
It is pretty much an average college in all other regards. So, this was all the data from my side about Narula Institute of Technology, Agarpara. I hope you got some clarification about the college. At last, it is all upon you to choose."
88,Narula Institute of Technology - [NIT Agarpara],Which college is better among JIS NARULA DR Sudhir Chandra or Guru Nanak of Kolkata for CSE?,"If we talk about the best engineering college for CSE among Brainware or Narula Institute of Technology, then NIT is best due to the following reasons:
NIRF Ranking: The institute has been constantly ranked among NIRF rankings for the last four years. It offers a plethora of opportunities to students and many different courses.
Scholarships offered: NIT offers various scholarships to the students like the Sitaram Jindal scholarship, Pragati and Saksham scholarship, SVMCM scholarship, Priyamvada Birla scholarship, Vidyalaxmi scholarship, OASIS scholarship, Kanyashree k2 scholarship, and many others.
Placements: During 2019-20, a total of 89% of students appeared in the entire placement process. Top recruiters like TCS, Infosys, ITC Infotech, etc participated in the drive. The training and placement cell at NIT conducts various seminars, workshops, aptitude tests, and many grooming sessions to enhance your skills for the various interviews. It will give industrial knowledge and hands-on experience to all the students.
Narula Institute of Technology is best if you are enrolling for CSE. You will be given innumerable opportunities ranging from good placements, scholarships, and great industry exposure."
89,PES College of Engineering - [PESCE],"Which is best among PESIT (south campus), PES University (Banashankari) and PES College of Engineering (Mandya)?","PES University is the best of the three because it is autonomous, whereas the other two are still affiliated with VTU. Because PES University is an autonomous college, it has a better course than other VTU colleges, and for your information, it is ranked third in Karnataka engineering colleges. However, the only way to get into PES University is to take the PESSAT or KCET; COMED-K scores are accepted in the other two colleges and the KCET.
They have superior infrastructure, resources, and financial resources. PESIT South Campus shares placement with PESIT Main Campus, so placement students from both campuses almost receive equal pay. However, it would help if you score well in either the CET or the COMED-K to be admitted to any of the PESIT south campus branches."

Though placements primarily depend on the candidate’s dedication and hard work, RNSIT has a greater edge over good opportunities in the industry.
RNSIT and CMRIT have an almost similar level of growth. But to some extent, RNSIT is preferred over CMRIT due to the overall placement scenario, availability of companies and packages offered.
Key highlights - RNSIT:
RNSIT is famous for its teaching faculty, the way they help students and encourage them in the curriculum and placement.
Going with the fame too, RNSIT is preferred. Among the three institutes, RNSIT has the lowest closing ranks in COMEDK and KCET.
Ranking-wise, RNSIT leads in the race due to the lowest overall fees and a good amount of facilities offered.
So, it is evident that RNSIT is the most preferred institute for ISE among the three."

95,Haldia Institute of Technology - [HIT],What is your review of Haldia Institute of Technology?,"Haldia Institute of Technology had a glorious past, marked with excellent placement and achievements of students in various fields. But, at present, it is not in a good state. Considering most reviews, it is not an institute recommended for students.
The points below give a brief overview of the institute:
There are reviews about Haldia Institute of Technology stating its huge campus and great campus life. But, when placement is concerned, students are mostly unsuccessful in getting their dream jobs.
Considering the past success rate of students, most of them received no support from the college in their hard work. There was no contribution of the institute in its placement, and the alumni would have achieved their goals elsewhere too.
The training and placement cell is not at all dedicated to their work of pitching various companies to conduct recruitment drives in the institute.
The labs are in a bad condition and had a lack of necessary equipment in them. The institute focuses on beautifying the campus with plants and decorations, rather than investing in building proper machinery for technical works.
The brightest students of branches like CSE and IT are placed in mass recruiting companies like TCS and Wipro, which clears the fact that placements are lacking.
The points above may be disappointing for new aspirants, but this is the truth. There are several much better institutes which candidates should opt for. You should go to colleges in big cities, which usually have better exposure, surrounded by corporations.
You can use their free time a lot better in those institutes, developing their skill set. Even though the core branches in HIT can be somewhat considered, CSE and IT are not at all recommended."
95,Haldia Institute of Technology - [HIT],How good is Haldia Institute Of Technology?,"Haldia Institute of Technology is the better choice of the two due to the following reasons.
Infrastructure: (Winning Institution - HIT)
Infrastructure wise Haldia Institute of Technology is better than Techno India.

98,The National Institute of Engineering - [NIE],"Which is better for CSE: NIE Mysore, Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering or Sir MVIT?","My sister took her CSE degree from NIE Mysore. It seems to be the better between the two. Here's why:
The placement rate is good. It was 97% this year, compared to DSCE's 75%. Sir MVIT matches the placement rate of NIE but the reputation of NIE is stronger in the industry.
NIE has an excellent infrastructure as well. It has worked on its expansion into an ultra-modern design in the past 5 years and has incorporated excellent facilities for sports and academic development. 
The location of Mysore can be great to explore. Do not think that it's a small city, it has all the amenities and recreational and professional sites you'd need to work as an engineer. Apart from the 3 malls, you will discover plenty of places to explore during the 4 years of your academic life."

99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],What is it like to study at NERIST?,"My brother recently graduated from the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology (NERIST).
The institute has a great blend of diversity, unlike any other institutes in India. 90% of the seats are for the eight north-eastern states with an equal number of seats. 10% of the reserved seats are for the all-India quota. You will get to learn about different cultures and lifestyles. 
The infrastructure of the institute is great. There are hostels, lecture centers, laboratory facilities, auditorium, convenience store, canteen, medical facilities available on campus. 
Apart from the cultural aspect, the college fee is low, and the professors are graduates from top IITs and NITs. It gives an edge to NERIST over other institutes."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],Is it good to join NERIST after 10th?,"It will be more beneficial if you join NERIST after class 10th than after 12th because the first 2 semesters will cover the syllabus from 11th and 12th Physics, Chemistry, and Maths as well.
Apart from the technical and theoretical knowledge, proper exposure will be offered. Civil students are taught courses like surveying, construction, building construction, water supply engineering. These are mostly taught in the 3rd and 4th semesters. By the end of the 5th semester, you will get a lot of exposure equivalent to class 12th. 
Overall NERIST is good, considering infrastructure, facilities provided and events held. The only thing that could be improved is the quality of the food. They can try making it more hygienic."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],Could anyone give me some insight about NERIST?,"The hostel and the campus itself is very good and some of the key highlights are: -
The majority of the students are from North India so it caters to their needs giving them the preference.
This provides the students time to explore the culture, language, and sensibilities.
They have very good sporting facilities.
The campus has 7 boys’ and 2 girls’ hostels. 
The campus is very beautiful and is near a river with greenery all around. It provides an ideal environment for academics."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],What is the condition of NERIST?,"One of the friends is currently studying at NERIST and according to him the condition is developing and getting better over time. The campus has 24 hours wifi facility, enabling you to explore and look for opportunities.
Although all of the departments are not in good condition, CSE and ECE departments were not functioning to their proper extent. With time it is getting better. Facilities offered at other departments are not the best but decent. 
Overall, NERIST is a good place to study. You will learn a lot and get to meet many people from different backgrounds and cultures."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],Is NERIST good in terms of placement?,"NERIST was once considered one of the best institutes in the region. The placement record was remarkable and according to the standard of the industry. 
However, the quality of the institute has started to fall in the current situation. It does not fit as per the mark of a Regional deemed university. Companies like Tech Mahindra, Power grid corporation, Wipro, Oil India, Infosys, Cummin India, TCS, visit the campus nowadays. 
Categories NERIST
Placement Percentage 60%
Highest CTC 10-12 LPA

The institute is expecting more recruiters as there is a railway facility in Arunachal Pradesh. Apart from on-campus placements, you can also look for off-campus placements and government jobs."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],I had cracked NEE 1 with a good rank. Should I leave the opportunity of getting into NERIST because I want to appear for JEE after 2 years?,"A lot of my friends studied NERIST. According to them, it offers admission in three modules, Certificate, Diploma, and Degree programs, based on the entrance scores in NEE 1, NEE 2, and NEE 3, respectively.
The eligibility for taking the NEE 1 exam is to pass matriculation or 10th class. It offers admission in the certificate program equivalent to ITI or 10+2 class as declared by UGC.
Therefore, if you take admission through NEE 1 in NERIST, two years down the line of studying the basic module, you will be equivalent to an HSC student. So, yes, you can appear for JEE."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],What is it like to study CS in NERIST?,"CSE in NERIST is not a great option in terms of money and time. As one of my friends studied there, here’s what I got to know about it:
The syllabus hasn’t been updated to the latest needs. 
Some of the professors have no teaching experience. They are more focused on students mugging up rather than learning.
You will be taught languages that are no longer properly working in the industry. 
The labs here are messy and no the library is too small to accommodate a large group of students. 
The local Arunchali students tend to boss around and threaten everyone.
The non local teachers also fear the local students and hence they give them better marks, to avoid the commotion. 
Categories CS at NERIST
Course Fee 22,300
Highest CTC 10 LPA
Average CTC 3.3 LPA
Recruiting Companies Godrej, Infosys, Sony, GAIL, etc.
Moreover, the environment is not academic-friendly. The placements earlier were very bad but have improved eventually. CS has few such good teachers who really care about their students and how much they are actually learning."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],Will I get a 100% job after I finish my engineering from NERIST?,"Since you are concerned about whether or not the institution will be able to offer you a complete 100% placement opportunity, then it is important for you to understand that an institute, regardless of its prospects, can never ensure placements. 
You definitely have a good chance of exposure in the fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and civil engineering. According to the placement highlights the highest CTC offered is 3 LPA. Most IT companies come for the placement drive. 
The institute will offer decent opportunities but you also need to put in efforts to get decent placements."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],Is a B.Tech possible without a diploma in NERIST?,"Yes, B.Tech is possible without a diploma, after the new changes made by the NERIST curriculum. One of my friends studied there, and here’s what I got to know from him.
The institute has 3 different requirements for admission depending on the course. The NERIST entrance exams are: -
NEE: After secondary school (10th)
NEE 2: After the senior or the higher secondary 12th
NEE 3: After completing a 3-year course Diploma.
If you take admission on the basis of marks scored in 12th, then you will get a 4-degree. However, if you leave the college after 2 years, then you will be given a Diploma certificate."
99,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology - [NERIST],I have secured 2nd rank in the wait-listed candidates in the all-India general category. Will I get a seat at NERIST?,"One of my friends took admission in NERIST. According to him, your luck will play a big part in bagging the seats. Students who have been far behind you in the waiting list ended up getting admission. Luck plays a major role because some students do not attend the counseling session which leaves some of the seats vacant.
The process of selection is not that complicated. 
The candidates in the PRC ranking are allotted seats no matter what state they belong to. 
Everyone is assured of seats. 
In the case of agricultural engineering, a lot of people do not know about it so candidates who do, do end up getting seats.
For NEE, there are probably 40 seats, 8 from the states of North East India including the All India quota and the PRC rank holders. 
So, four students for each group get their seats allotted to them and the PRC rank guarantees a student a seat in their own desired branch if the four seats have already been taken.
In the case of Arunachal Pradesh, however, the counseling session for the students belonging to that state is held on another day. So if a student does get a seat, it may not be the one they were looking for."

102,Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology - [GRIET],Should I prefer Sreenidhi or GRIET?,"It is suggested not to go with either of the colleges mentioned in the question. They offer a mundane college life without any enthusiastic approach towards academics as well as extracurriculars. If you want your college life to be like that then join VNR or GRIET.
Although, many people consider VNR to be better in comparison with GRIET. Microsoft is one of the only good companies that recruit students enrolled in VNR.
My advice for you would be to just live away from your home and get enrolled in a decent University. This way, you can learn a lot about life and what it's like to be out of your comfort zone for a long period.
You can improve your communication skills and learn to communicate with someone who does not speak the same language which you do. You will meet people of different backgrounds and who belong to different cultures and traditions.
Go out and explore all the opportunities that the world has in store for you. No matter what happens, you will be able to learn a lot about life during your college years."

Is it worth joining?,"A few of my friends studied at Saveetha School of Engineering and they did not have a good experience at the institute. Here are some of their input regarding the institute.
The management is not that good and they don’t cooperate well with parents. 
If you have any quire regarding the institute at the time of admission, it is likely to get ignored.
My friend who is a female started from her place at 11 pm and reaches the campus before 6 am because there’s no train/bus after 11 pm. Instead of addressing the transport issue, they did not allow her to enter the campus because the rules say so. At last, she has to sit on-road and wait till the college opening time. 
The hostel fee structure is increased every year.
The only good thing you can get there is placement. No doubt they are good but you can better placements in good colleges with a good environment.
According to a few of my friends, most of the experienced faculties left the institute and there is the mostly Fresher staff. 
So, it will be better to consider other options for your degree."
107,Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering - [PCCOE],Which is better: VIIT Pune or PCCOE Pune?,"If you are planning to go for electronics and communication technology (EnTC) then opt for VIIT Pune.
It has a well-strategic academic curriculum for EnTC and the placement rate is also highly appreciable. The average salary is Rs 5.44 lakh. It has a beautiful campus, central library, conference room, and seminar hall which will win your heart. Whereas for PCCOE, Pune you'll find decent placement with a very average salary. You will find a wide variety of opportunities at VIIT.
The most unique feature that makes VIIT special is its best-known faculties in Pune, having tie-up with different colleges, government research institute, projects that will offer your better exposure and credible opportunities in your internship as well as in your job. 
Being an autonomous institute now, you'll get a B.Tech degree instead of a BE degree, and it will get you a better project and help you enhance your resume profile. 
Students at VIIT are offered a 6-month internship with a reputed company. On the other hand, in PCCOE, there is a rare opportunity for an internship. Students have only received a maximum of 2-week internship and learned nothing.
In terms of placements, VIIT is the best when compared to PCCOE. The table below shows the statistics for VIIT:

107,Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering - [PCCOE],"Which is better, a CSE at PCCOE Pune or an IT at VIIT Pune?","Having to know people from both the institutes, I can say that they are equally good. But my choice will be inclined towards IET DAVV as it is more popular among students as well as professionals.
Both the institutes have good placement records and stats, especially in the CSE branch. If you’re a resident near Maharashtra then POCCE would be a good option whereas if you’re near Madhya Pradesh then IET- DAVV would be the suitable choice.
The numbers of companies visiting both campuses are approximately equal with core companies and other companies included.
They mainly get into consultancy providing companies.
As a student, it all depends on the amount of effort you put into your study and career and how smartly you put your efforts.
It all depends on you the institutes just provide and act as a supporting block helping to shape you and your carrier.

108,Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering - [DJSCE],Which college is better? KJ Somaiya or DJ Sanghvi?,"The placement in D.J. Sanghvi is decent with salary packages ranging from 3-12 Lakhs per annum. The points below give a brief overview of the run-through of the entire placement scenario in D.J. Sanghvi.
The placement session usually starts from the beginning of the 4th year. The first company visiting the campus is mostly Morgan Stanley, providing the highest salary package (14-16 LPA).
The entire placement sessions go on for a year, with an overall of about 35-40 companies, and a salary range of about 3-12 LPA offered to students.
J.P Morgan performs a 24-hour hackathons “Code for Good” and recruits students from it.
Some other names of MNCs visiting the campus just after Morgan Stanley include Directi, ZS associates, Indus Valley, etc. Several companies like EnY, LTI, Deloitte, Dollar Capital, etc provides appreciable salary packages.
Almost every student from Computer science and IT gets at least one job offer in placement. Mass recruiters like TCS and Infosys visit the campus, recruiting a bunch of students.

Overall, the placements can be considered to be really good in D.J. Sanghvi and so, taking up a job with a decent salary before a Masters's degree is quite satisfying."
108,Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering - [DJSCE],What is the placement scenario in KJ Somaiya or DJ Sanghvi?,"A few years back, one of my friends took admission at KJ Somaiya via the ILS quota in the department of Mechanical Engineering. There were around 12 seats available. The fee was the same for everyone, irrespective of the quota. 
He filled up a form on the college’s website and a merit list came out based on their CET marks. My friend’s merit number was in the 70s. If you want admission, you will have to be physically present on the day of counseling along with the fee. They were called for admission based on their merit number. The number of seats available was displayed on an LCD for all the branches. As people took admission, it got updated. When your number is called, you will have to go to the table and select your branch. 
This was the process followed a few years back. However, I do not think that there has been any change in the process."
108,Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering - [DJSCE],"Do colleges in Mumbai such asSPIT, KJ Somaiya and DJ Sanghavi have management quota?","I can give you information about KJ Somaiya and DJ Sanghvi since I have friends from these institutes. 
If you are inclined towards an autonomous university, then KJ Somaiya would be a better choice. Apart from that, you can choose either institute based on how close it is to your location.

Most of the faculties don’t have much experience. The teaching methodology used is outdated.
The past few years’ placements haven’t been good. Students from core branches struggle a lot with placements. Only the IT and CSE branches had decent placements.
Manipal University Jaipur fees for B.Tech are around INR 12.61 LPA. While the return on investment isn’t good. 
It’s better if you choose the main Manipal campus. It offers better academics and placements."
120,Manipal University - [MUJ],How are the placements at Manipal University Jaipur?,"Yes, it is quite good for middle-class students. Some even take education loans to study at the Manipal University. You will find students from a similar financial background as you.
The university has a very good reputation both nationally and internationally. It is known to offer the best opportunities for placements. One good point is that it does not sponsor seats, unlike various other institutes.
However, there are other things to take into account. A huge number of students arrive from very affluent lifestyles. Students sometimes fall trap of unlawful activities outside the campus. It is because of factors like that they suffer from distraction both academically and mentally. 
Hence, if you have an inclination towards it and you are keen to take forward your career without further hindrance or distraction, then Manipal University can be a good choice nonetheless."

There is an excellent coding culture in LNMIIT. Students from the institute participate in various national and international competitions and hackathons.
The only disadvantage of LNMIIT Jaipur, when compared to IIIT Vadodara, is its high fees. As evident from the above table, the total fee of LNMIIT Jaipur is almost double that of IIIT Vadodara.

122,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],"How is the placement at SRM University, Chennai?","I don't know much about CBIT and Hindustan University. But I won’t recommend you the NCR campus of SRM.
It is in fact not located in the National Capital Region. It is situated in Modinagar (Sikrikalan to be precise).The management of this college is very poor. You’ll be wasting a lot of energy for simple requests like getting statements attested, acquiring a recommendation letter, getting fee refunds, etc.
I studied CSE over there. The faculty for CSE is considered to be the best. However, in reality, most teachers don’t even have an idea of their specialization. You’ll find that the same teacher is taking classes for various specializations like Data Structures, Mobile Computing, Theory of Computation, Compiler, etc. New ideas aren’t encouraged in the classroom. 
The hardware in CSE labs is top notch, but the software is all outdated. The hostels are decent but the mess food is disappointing. The hostel wardens do minimum to maintain discipline. For placements, you’ll have to travel all the way to Chennai, with no support from the management, and no accommodation facilities. 
Thus, do not choose the NCR campus of SRM University, especially for the CSE program."
122,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],"Which college is better, CBIT, SRM or HITS (Hindustan University)?","Amrita Coimbatore and SRM Katangalathur are excellent institutes and are listed among the best private institutes in the country. Both the institute have certain advantages, which makes them the right choice for students of specific types. But, Amrita University is somewhat considered to be a better option among the two.
The points below state the advantages of both the institutes, which would help students, make a choice between the two.
In terms of academics and placement of students, Amrita University stands out among the two by a considerable amount. It offers better placements to students, especially in branches like Computer Science and Engineering.
The overall student life is much better in SRM than that in Amrita Coimbatore. The in-campus facilities in SRM are world-class, which offers better living standards for students.
Students in Amrita University have to study a lot and are said to spend their four years of engineering in a lot of hardship. The institute and its faculties almost force the students to perform well in academics.
Therefore, having the most positive factors into account, Amrita University is a better choice among the two for a degree in Computer Science and Engineering."
122,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],Which college should I go SRM or NMIMS for CSE?,"According to my friend at SRM, the KTR campus of SRM is the best choice. If you consider factors like faculty, placements, and a lot more. The points below will provide you a brief overview of all the institutes stated above and the advantages of SRM over them.
SRM University has three campuses, first in Kattankulathur, second in Ramapuram, and third in Vadapalani. The campus in Kattankulathur (KTR) is marked as the best among them.
In SRM KTR, will make you a real engineer. It has excellent faculty, provides a lot of on-campus placement opportunities, and is also good in extra-curricular activities.
The other two campuses of SRM, Ramapuram, and Vadapalani, are somewhat satisfactory, but not as good as the KTR campus.
Talking about the NCR, the campus is quite far away from Delhi, which results in a lot of travel to and from Delhi on weekends.
The faculty of NCR is not that good and so students have to be dependent on self-study. The placements are decent because it is held in the Chennai (KTR) campus. But, the NCR campus has much lesser fees than the Chennai campus and so, it is considered better.
The Manipal University is called a happening campus, which provides excellent college life, extra-curricular activities, party culture, etc. But, students in Manipal University should be aware of the bad habits on campus and choose friends wisely for the same reason.
The fee structure in Manipal University is also on a slightly higher side. It provides average quality placement to students.

122,SRM Institute of Science and Technology - [SRMIST],"Which college shall I prefer for a CSE: LNCT BHOPAL or SRM Chennai, Ramapuram Campus?","The comparison between Thapar and SRM is definitely not up to the mark because Thapar is better than SRM. Having friends studying in both these colleges, I can assure you to confidently choose Thapar over SRM.
Being a private college SRM had never paid attention to the quality education or any other criteria which a better college should do. It's the same as all other private colleges in India.
Thapar should be preferred. Be it faculty, environment, infrastructure, education, and placements, Thapar is much better.

According to the student's priorities and choice of place, the Institute can be selected. But among these two, Thapar excels over SRM."

124,Manipal Academy of Higher Education - [MAHE],"Which is better, Manipal University or SRM University?","I have a few friends pursuing courses at MIT Manipal. One of my friends is in Mechanical Engineering and he is happy to be there. 
Campus infrastructure is very good and well-maintained compared to any NITs and IITs. 
Students enrolled and Peer groups might not be as good as compared to IITs and NITs but still, you can meet people of different places with unique talents. You can achieve Good social exposure that can help to develop your personality. 
The faculties are average, you need to depend on yourself for academics, which is true for most colleges. 
The scope of Research might not be as good but the students of Manipal University made a student satellite which can be considered a big achievement.
On average, over 250+ recruiting teams visit MIT Manipal for UG & PG campus placements & internship recruitment every year. The recent placement statistics for the institute are as follows.

126,Sharda University,What is your review of Sharda University?,"One of my friends studied at Sharda University and according to him, it was the biggest regret of his life. He pointed out some good and bad things about the college, which I will be sharing with you.
There is no ragging and the infrastructure is pretty good. It is the only thing good about the college.
The university has many flaws like - 
The crowd and the overall exposure are not good. 
The tests conducted at Sharda are extremely easy and you do not need to study for more than a day before the exam. 
A GPA of 8+ can be easily scored, yet a majority of students are stuck around a GPA of 5 to 7.
The university has attendance criteria of 75% which is very strict. For students who travel via Sharda bus or metro from Delhi, it is very difficult to keep up with this.
The administration of the college is not good either. The complaints are mostly ignored.
Many workshops are conducted but the students are not able to attend them because of the attendance criteria. 
The hostels are in pretty bad condition too, so, it is better to opt for PGs or Private Hostels.
The faculty is not enthusiastic about teaching or researching in their field. 
In the first semester, a lot of time is wasted in learning Physics, Maths, Chemistry, Moral Science, EVS, Multimedia, AutoCAD, Mechanical in your B.Tech CSE. None of these subjects are related to the branch.
If you scored badly in JEE or any other competitive exam but are willing to improve yourself and do not see any other options available, then you can join Sharda University."
126,Sharda University,Which is better for a pharmacy course: Sharda University or Amity University?,"One of my seniors from school used to be a student of Sharda University and from what she has told me, the university has very good campus and the hostel facilities are some of the best he has come across. She spent a week thereafter graduation. Some of the features are:
The entire campus of Sharda University is wifi enabled.
The food from the mess is decent.
There are double/triple sharing rooms in the hostels.
There are several canteens within the campus.
There are students from different countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, etc., making interaction with various nationalities possible
During the month of Ramadan, there are separate food arrangements for students.
Facilities for sports like basketball, football, cricket, etc are also in the campus.
Greater Noida is developed and if you are an outsider it would be a good idea if you take the hostel right after admission. The infrastructure of the university is amazing and there are AC/non AC rooms in the hostels as well. In addition to that, there are attached as well as common washrooms for the students. The hostels have laundries too where the first few washes are free for the students."
127,SVKM's Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies - [NMIMS University],How is the new NMIMS campus in Navi Mumbai?,"Choosing between colleges like NMIMS Navi Mumbai or MDI Murshidabad is a bit typical as both hold their own place in top colleges. MDI Murshidabad was established before NMIMS Navi Mumbai in the year 2014. So, this factor plays an important role too.
NMIMS Navi Mumbai would be a better option considering its proximity to Mumbai.
Otherwise MDI Murshidabad would be a better option considering it is a comparatively older brand.
Discussing the placement report, both are performing evenly well with an average expected CTC of 8–9 LPA.
Further, NMIMS Mumbai is an old B-school with its substantial records whereas, MDIM is coming with a strong brand name with average salary 8–8.5 range which is similar to CTC of Tier 2 college.
Categories NMIMS Navi Mumbai MDI Murshidabad
Course Fee 16.54 lakh 10.42 lakh

Also, try to connect with the alumni of both the institutes, if at all you get anyone for NMIMS Navi Mumbai. Though MDIM is ahead of NMIMS Mumbai, NMIMS Navi Mumbai has the location advantage and the exposure you will get in Navi Mumbai & Mumbai."

129,Galgotias University - [GU],"Which is better, Galgotias University or Galgotia's College of Engineering for B.Tech CSE?","Both G L Bajaj and Galgotias University are decent options for CS or IT branches. However, you will like to refer to the following points before choosing one
Choose G.L. Bajaj if you are self-motivated and determined to work hard because the institute has a rigid academic environment with many restrictions on attendance and such. Galgotia University on the other hand offers a huge sense of freedom with no restrictions at all. You are free to do whatever you want.
Another major factor to consider is the distance from Greater Noida. G.L. Bajaj is situated in the heart of Greater Noida, whereas Galgotias University is situated almost 15-17 Km from Greater Noida.
Honestly, the faculty pool of both colleges is below average. However, if I were to compare then G L Bajaj still has a handful of experienced professors
Addressing the elephant in the room, it can be said that the placement scenario isn't very different at both the colleges. Galgotias University is newly established but is doing quite well in terms of placements. Here is a comparative analysis of the placement scenario of both the colleges

130,Nirma University,How is life at Nirma University?,"Nirma University has undergone a lot of improvement in facilities and campus with time in the last few years, along with its advancement in other aspects. 
A detailed description of the present life at Nirma University is stated below in points.
The classrooms have 6 ACs, individual chairs, a projector, which makes them a lot more comfortable for students.
In the library, students are now allowed to issue 5 books. There is an e-mail support system to notify students in case of an issue or deadline for renewal. 
There is a lot of improvement in the food quality in the canteen, which is now managed by honest people. In addition, Wi-Fi is now provided to every student.
The institute has the facility of a student academic calendar where everything is noted, from holidays to exam dates. 
There is a strict 85% minimum criterion. If you are unable to reach the 85% mark you have to face extra assignments, which can be done in teams too because quite a good number of students face that.
There are regular field trips arranged for students in modern technologies. Seminars and expert lectures are quite common too. Inside the campus, there are various technical and non-technical clubs that organize several events and workshops. 
The institute's clubs organize NU-TECH, the techno-management fest of the institute, where there are plenty of opportunities to showcase talent. Students from the institute have also been successful in GSoC and published papers in IEEE.
Therefore, life at Nirma University is worth exploring, with a lot of learning and enjoyment. It gives the opportunity to gain actual value in every aspect, being in the institute."
130,Nirma University,What is essentially wrong with Nirma University and how could those things be changed?,"One of my friends, who is working in Cognizant, has studied Electronics & Communication Engineering at Nirma University. As per her insights, the following are the things essentially wrong with the University.
If you are pursuing ECE and inclined towards programming, it is problematic.
There are companies like Motorola, ARM, STM, and others with 7.5 points as cut-off criteria. Even if you miss the cut-off by a margin, yet you cannot sit for interviews in these companies.
Some of the faculty is discouraging. They focus on bookish knowledge and are not open to new ideas. It is more like a school than a college.
Most top-scoring students are believed to be Idols, and the average scorers do not get any spotlight.
The labs are well-equipped, but most of the instruments do not work. Practical teaching is like spoon-feeding.
Attendance is given utmost importance on the campus. You will find students worrying more about attendance than academics.
You cannot afford to become a defaulter as there are consequences for it. The minimum attendance should be 85%.
Overall, the only way all this can go smoothly is to change the mentality by focusing on why and what to learn, future benefits, and practical approaches."
130,Nirma University,What is the current placement scenario of an MBA at Nirma University Ahmedabad? Is it worth joining considering ROI and other factors?,"Many of my friends are alumni of the Institute of Management, Nirma University, and also many of them are studying at other reputed colleges such as IIMs, IIFT, NMIMS, SIBM, and the likes. So, I am quite aware of the placement situations at these B-schools.
Nirma has been faring better than their peers with many companies of repute lining up for campus placements. Well on a comparison basis, the academic curriculum is at par with the best B-schools in the country with very accomplished faculty taking courses at the Institute. Nirma also offers good infrastructure, campus, etc.
Now, coming to the most important factor, i.e. ROI, Nirma is definitely worth the investment that you make. And if you have decent academics and skills, you will get a good placement through the campus drive.
Here is a brief highlight of the recent placement statistics for Nirma.

133,Chitkara University - [CU],What is your review of Chitkara University?,"If you’re willing to join Punjab campus with 56 marks in JEE Mains and 70% in CBSE boards, it would be extremely difficult. 
It would be best for you to go to the Baddi campus with that much score. Equal opportunities are provided to students of both the campus.

Academics: 
The course curriculum and grading system are designed in such a way that, you won’t be able to slack off. The campus seniors have taken a great initiative to decrease the academic load of juniors through the LASC program. Through this program, seniors teach important topics, resolve doubts and also help juniors plan out preparation strategies for examinations.

136,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],"Which is better, HBTI Kanpur (the best college of UPTU), NIT (any) or the IIIT (any)?","The answer is definitely yes as the Indian Institute of Engineering and technology is more than 60 years older than Harcourt Butler University. Both the colleges have rich heritage and have contributed immensely to the development of information technology in India.
The prominent factors which make IIEST better than HBTU are :
Alumni - IIEST has a more renowned base of alumni ranging from USA world’s Greatest Structural Engineer to reputed researchers, scientists, educators and professors. HBTU has not a very attractive list of alumni in the domain of information technology.
Placement - The placement details of both the colleges are as follows:

HBTU offers a higher package but the number of individuals getting that package is very less. Also, the average package is less as compared to IIEST. It also attracts more core recruiters than HBTU.
Curriculum - IIEST has an updated & dynamic syllabus as it has to keep at par with the standards in the market. It also holds top ranks in the research parameters in several domains. The allocation of funds by the government has also made it even easier.
IIEST, therefore, makes a way ahead of HBTU due to various reasons but the choice can be easily influenced by other unmentioned factors like location, fee range, and scores in the competing examination."
136,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],Which one is better: HBTI Kanpur (IT) or IET Lucknow (CSE)?,"HBTI Kanpur and IET Lucknow offer admission through a state-level entrance exam known as UPSEE. Some sections of the entrance exam have direct questions referred from the NCERT books. Check the following points for subject-wise preparation:
Chemistry: NCERT books are more than enough as it has every little detail explained very well. Just going through it well enough will be more than enough in the exam. None of the questions in this section are outside of the NCERT textbook.
Physics: For the theory part, NCERT will be enough however, for the numerical, HC Verma will be a good addition along with the NCERT syllabus. The papers given in the back of the NCERT will give you an idea about the numerical.
Maths: The NCERT textbook and the practice book will be enough for the regular chapters except for the calculus part. You can also refer to other well-known books like S.L Loni will be useful. 
If your basics are clear and you have done enough practice for the exam, then you can easily score a decent rank in UPSEE. NCERT books will definitely help you cover all the topics in a simplified way and crack the exam."
136,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],"I am getting admission in HBTI, IET Lucknow, and MIT Manipal. Which one should I choose?","IIEST scores more than HBTU Kanpur according to the parameters mentioned below. Both colleges have a rich endowment. But, IIEST stands separately for spreading the entire IIT structure in India. IIEST has a more vibrant and strong Alumni base, but few institutes of India also rival it.
Placement:
IIEST Shibpur invited 90 reputed companies in the year 2020. 311 students got placed with the highest salary package of INR 41 LPA and an average package of 6 LPA.
HBTU Kanpur invited 26 major companies including Microsoft, Reliance, Samsung, IBM, etc that offered the highest salary package of 13 LPA and an average package of 4.2 LPA.
Eligibility:
IIEST Shibpur: The eligibility criteria under different courses for IIEST Shibpur is listed below.
B.Tech: 10+2 with 75% marks with a valid score in JEE Main
M.Tech: Pass in Graduation with a valid score in GATE
MBA: Pass in Graduation with a valid score CAT
HBTU Kanpur: The eligibility criteria under different courses for HBTU, Kanpur is listed below
B.Tech: 10+2 with 75% marks with a valid score in JEE Main
M.Tech: Pass in Graduation with a valid score in GATE
MBA: Pass in Graduation with a valid score CAT
Both the colleges accept a creamy layer of students with respective state exams and top-notch performers in their respective States. Both colleges have failed in doing so in recent years. The identity crisis could be partly blamed, but even academically it has failed in overriding top NIT and other colleges."
136,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],Is IIEST Shibpur better than HBTU Kanpur?,"Both of the institutions are situated at a distance of 80 km from each other. IET Lucknow is situated in the industrial capital of Uttar Pradesh and the HBTI Kanpur is situated in the Political capital. If you live in one of the two cities, you can choose accordingly; otherwise, this factor has no significance.
According to AKTU, both the institutes are ranked at number 1 and number 2 in UP, but the situation is completely different analytically. HBTI is a well-known institution and has been the parent institute of IIT Kanpur and Uttar Pradesh Textile Institute. 
Both the institutes are government-run with complete control over examinations and the curriculum of courses offered by them.
If you enjoy programming, Computer Science would be the appropriate course for you, while Mechanical Engineering is for those who want to acquire a genuine sense of what engineering is all about.
The faculty of IET Lucknow is better than that of HBTI. 
You will have numerous opportunities outside the campus. The placement statistics for the mechanical department are not very good at both institutes, but placement in the CS department is extremely good.
Make your decision based on the branch and not the institution as it would have a major impact on your career."
136,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],Can we get HBTI Kanpur or IET Lucknow by just doing NCERT thoroughly?,"I have friends from both Thapar and HBTI, so I think I can answer this question.
Thapar is a private university, so naturally, it has better infrastructure.
HBTI, on the other hand, is one of the oldest institutions of the country and at the same time has gained much reputation among the students. It also has an extensive alumni network.
Also, the chemical branch at HBTI Kanpur is well-known among students for its highly qualified and skillful faculty members.
Here are the recent placement highlights of the institutes.
Institute Thapar University HBTI Kanpur
Average CTC 8 LPA 7.18 LPA
Highest CTC 43 LPA 60 LPA
Major recruiters IBM, Wipro, Infosys, D.E Shaw India, etc. Microsoft, Google, Oyo Rooms
If you are aspiring for chemical technology or related branches then go for HBTI Kanpur and if you want to pursue some core courses then Thapar University is the best option."
136,Harcourt Butler Technological University - [HBTU],Which is better among IIEST Shibpur and HBTU Kanpur?,"Having friends from IET and studying at BIET, I have enough knowledge about both the institutions. So, my suggestion will be HBTI. It will be a better choice than the others. But before selecting any college you must first learn about each college and its branches.

137,Jaipur National University - [JNU],Is Jaipur National University as a distance education good or not?,"From what is normally heard from the students of Jaipur National University, it would be a good idea to look for other institutes. 
The customer service of the university is very bad and the support system for education is non-existent.
The assignments are more or less the same every year but the answers can rarely be found in the study material provided by the university. 
There is extra unnecessary information crammed in the study materials.
The pattern of exams is pathetic. 
There are no objective-type questions and the students will have to write essay-type answers which can be very tiring.
The grievances are not addressed by the administration neither by mail nor by phone. 
The results are released about four months after the conclusion of the exams.
The degree is sent to the students after about a year of their completion of the course. The staff here is also very disrespectful and far from cooperative. If distance education is in your plans, then go for IGNOU."
137,Jaipur National University - [JNU],How good is Jaipur national university?,"Jaipur National University is quite average. Most of the students opted for this university because they did not have much of a choice.

No workshops are held in the university and it never organizes tours for the students.
In addition to these, the labs are very poor and there are little to no instruments in the labs. 
The faculty members are very laid back and they also lack the capability.

137,Jaipur National University - [JNU],Is Jaipur National University good for an MBBS?,"The Jaipur National University is a very popular university and the hostel facilities available in this university are amazing.

142,Pandit Deendayal Energy University - [PDEU],What is your review of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University Gandhinagar (PDPU)?,"The cut-off rank (or score) required for PDPU in JEE or GUJCET changes every year. The corresponding score and rank dependency is also different every year.
The expected cut-off ranks for PDPU from JEE Main are listed below.
Department

One of my friends got admission in the Chemical Engineering branch with a 120 cutoff in JEE Main back in 2016. Chemical is among the fastest filling departments along with Petroleum and Computer Science.
For GUJCET candidates, a score of around 95 should be sufficient for PDPU. For SC/ST candidates, even 85 would do the same.
For JEE Main candidates, 130-150 is considered as a sufficient score for general students for getting the top branches in PDPU.
The above ranks and cut-offs are assumptions and can be considered as tentative values."
143,Alliance University,What is the average package in Alliance University Bangalore for an MBA graduate?,"Alliance University is a great option for MBA aspirants as the foreign exposure you get through the program is worth the effort. 
You get to interact with geniuses from countries like Russia, Poland, South Africa, and also the USA.
The parity of the faculty cannot be doubted as they are experts in their fields. They prepare you for the harsh realities of the corporate world. 
The syllabus is very different from that of other universities and emphasis is laid more on practical implementation than theoretical knowledge. 
Students can make the most by attending the classes regularly as the classroom learning experience is very dynamic and more than enough.
All in all, MBA from Alliance University is really worth it given that you are willing to commit yourself 100%."

145,Amity University,Is Amity University Kolkata good for BTech CSE ?,"The hostels of Amity University Kolkata are pathetic with no good facilities that might improve the standards of living. The fees are as high as 90k every year, which does not even include food expenses. The food served here is only veg with no non-veg cuisine. 
The warden too is very uncooperative and lacks empathy. The rules here are followed strictly and any carelessness on the part of students is taken care of with great discipline. Students are not allowed to eat chicken or even use kettles.
On weekends, students can go out of the campus only for an hour or so. A day's leave requires permission from various concerned persons and is a tedious process. The rules are even more strict for girls who have to return at 5 pm. There are hundreds of formalities after which you will be allowed to go. I would recommend you rent a flat if you want to make your stay a bit flexible and experience the freedom of college life."
145,Amity University,"How is the hostel of Amity University, Kolkata?","Yes, Amity University Kolkata is accredited with an 'A' grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). Amity Universities are fully Government Recognised that is they are recognized by University Grants Commission (UGC) and thus the degrees awarded by them are recognized by the UGC. Amity University is a full-fledged university and not a deemed university.
Additionally, Amity University Kolkata is also a member of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) and is known for its excellent pedagogy and choice-based credit system."
145,Amity University,What are the class timings at Amity University Kolkata ?,"Yes, Amity University, Kolkata is a great option for an M.Sc in Biotechnology. The Biotechnology department has a brilliant faculty base. 
The job opportunities are fewer in this field. But if you are skilled, you can get good salary packages through campus placement. According to the highlights of Amity University Kolkata placement, students receive an average CTC of INR 3.5 LPA."
146,VIT Bhopal University,"Which Institution is better, VIT Bhopal campus or Thapar University","Among these two, NIT Raipur will be a better choice. Here is some insight about the institutes.
VIT Bhopal: In recent years, admissions in VIT were open for VIT rank > 1 Lakh, and even after that, the seats remained empty. As this is a new institute the infrastructure and faculty base is not that strong. It lacks good infrastructural facilities. There is no alumni network.
NIT Raipur: On the other hand, NIT Raipur is one of the most popular colleges in our country and you will have good faculty there. The only concern is your choice of branch. Choose B.Arch only if you are truly interested in Architecture.
Here are the recent placement statistics for the courses mentioned in the question.
Parameters
VIT Bhopal CSE
NIT Raipur B.Arch
Average CTC
6.5 LPA
9.5 LPA
Highest CTC

30 LPA
Hence, choosing NIT Raipur over VIT Bhopal will be a very good choice as it is a much better college and it will help you to shape your career and future."
147,Acharya Institute of Technology - [AIT],What is your review of Acharya Institute of Technology?,"Acharya Institute of Technology is a very good college for engineering courses and many students across the country apply for admission to this college every year. I can give you some insight about the institute as I have a few friends at the institute.
Academics: It is very good and the faculty are experienced and talented especially in the ISE and CSE branches. Here the students are also given some extra classes on placements assistance and personality development. 
Extracurricular activities: The college fest is the best among the colleges of Bangalore. Here students also get the opportunity to take part in various competitions, from cricket to table tennis, and in national-level college events too. 
Infrastructure: It offers modern facilities to the students. You can Google the institute to see pictures of the institute. You will find the fee structure of the college on the COMEDK website. 
Placements: The placements are decent enough. But if you can appear for exams such as AMCAT and Elitmus then you expect good companies offering good packages. And getting a job depends on you mostly based on your skills and knowledge and how you can present yourself in front of your recruiters. 
Hence, Acharya Institute of Technology is a very good college with good academics, experienced professors, and decent placements."
148,MVJ College of Engineering - [MVJCE],What is the average/highest salary package of MVJ College of Engineering in Bangalore? How is its reputation?,"As a former student of MVJCE Bangalore, I can only enlighten you about my college. 
A lot depends on the branch for which you seek admission into MVJCE. Moreover, if you are planning to join the college through Management Quota, I would recommend you to not waste your money. 
The college was good for all the branches in the past, but now, only the Computer Science branch is good. I would strictly suggest that you refrain from opting MVJCE for Aeronautical Engineering. 
As for Reva University, try reaching out to some seniors from there. This will give you a better idea of the institution, and how good the engineering studies over there are."

Campus:
Attendance is of utmost importance at DIT, most of the faculty members ask to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in their subject.
There are several workshops held by the university which will provide some knowledge. But for this, a student should engage on their own. The university does not provide attendance for extracurricular activities.
Only limited facilities are good on the campus. These are the clubs and teams from the Mechanical and Automobile Department.
These teams actively participate in multiple competitions like Formula Student Design Challenge and BAHA at the national level every year infests like AUDICIOUS, DIT Motoracing, etc.
The college has an active club from the Mechanical Engineering Department, Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE). Which organizes guest lectures and technical learning workshops.
People who involve themselves in DIT Motoracing learn a lot about automobiles. They can work in the workshops and get a useful experience.
DIT Dehradun requires working towards the goal from the first day itself. Maintaining an average CGPA of 7.5 and learning from the department is important. You should also strive to develop a sound understanding of the software required for your branch."
150,Bharath University - Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research - [BIHER],Is Bharath University the best or Veltech?,"No, as per my sister’s personal experience the placement reports are completely fake and only 20% of the students are recruited in very low-level industry packages. The campus remains closed for many months every year due to the strikes and fights on the campus.
These are the few problems faced by students frequently that hinder their growth and destroy the study environment due to which students cannot even concentrate completely on their curriculum.
Try to abstain from getting admission to Bharath University for any of the courses. Develop your overall personality by getting admission into some other decent college."
150,Bharath University - Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research - [BIHER],Is it really worth it to do CSE for a B.Tech from Bharath University?,"For mechanical engineering, Bharat University is not a better option.

Here are some points that why you shouldn’t go to Bharath University.
Bharat University is less popular than the IITs or NITs.
The faculty of the university is efficient but not very helpful when it comes to teaching students.
Bharat University gives more importance to the CGPA of students than knowledge.
The infrastructure is not up to the mark, as it has underdeveloped laboratories and classrooms. 
Preference is given to theoretical knowledge over practical knowledge.
The recruiting companies include Amazon, TCS, Nissan, BHEL, HAL, etc.
You must have a good CGPA to sit on-campus placements. And good school records to get placed with a good company. 
At least 70% marks is required to be eligible for placements.
Hence, the placement, academic, infrastructure of Bharat University is not worthy. It is recommended to choose your mechanical engineering degree from a more prestigious college."
151,GLA University,How are the B.Tech placements at the GLA University in Mathura?,"Both these universities are very good and have their own advantages, but among these two GLA University will be a better option, and here are some reasons as to why.

The students are assigned various live projects where they have to work on building drones, mobile apps, solar-based systems, e-bikes, go-karts, etc.
The faculty of this college are very talented and experienced. There are almost 50 guest lecturers visiting the college who also conduct various workshops for the students.

With such diverse courses, Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science is the best choice to study arts and science courses."
155,"Vels Institute of Science, Technology & Advanced Studies",What is the dress code at Vels University?,"Indian Maritime University (IMU) Chennai is obviously better than Vels University. It has a brand of its own and is known outside of Chennai as well. Vels University, on the other hand, is just like any other university and anyone hardly outside Chennai even knows about it. 
The study environment at Vels University is not at all good though other facilities are good to decent. I would say that if you want to relax and just want a degree after 3-4 years of enjoyment, go to Vels University. Otherwise, IMU Chennai is the one to go for."
155,"Vels Institute of Science, Technology & Advanced Studies","Which is better, Vels University or Veltech University?","One of my friends recently graduated from VEL Tech University and according to him, IT usually gets more companies than other departments such as MECH, EEE, AUTO, and AERO. 
A few students get placed in the core sectors; however, these core sector companies have limited vacancies, and they want students who are experienced (meaning they have held an internship or completed some projects), and they don't want to waste time training freshmen. 
You don't need to look for a job to get better placements; instead, you should master abilities in a specific field better than everyone else, then apply to the firms/companies, and you will almost certainly get hired.
Here is the highlight of the recent placement drive at the institute. 
The placement average for the institute is 89%.
The average CTC offered by the institute is 17 LPA. While the highest CTC offered is 28 LPA.
The major recruiters at the institute are Dell, TCS, Infosys, Amazon, Byju’s, etc. 
Almost 75% of students participate in internships. 
The institute has a great placement cell that attracts a large number of enterprises with higher packages. In addition, twice-weekly career guidance workshops are held. Professors with advanced degrees are assigned to teach online tests, which are administered under the supervision of a knowledgeable teaching team."
155,"Vels Institute of Science, Technology & Advanced Studies","Which is the better college for arts and science, Vels Institute or Hindustan University, Chennai?","Doing an MCA from Vels University will not be worth it. The college will add nothing to your professional career and the degree will become just another degree which I do not think should be your intention especially when going for a master’s degree.
Following are a few points I would like to mention –
Infrastructure: The campus is very small and you can literally cover the whole campus within a few minutes. You will not enjoy good campus life.
Education: There are some extremely talented and experienced teachers. However, very few can guide you properly towards your goal properly.
Placement:  This is one of the biggest disappointments as not even 10 companies visit the campus even though they claim a 100% placement record.
Location: It is located at Pallavaram and it is still close to the bus and railway stations. So this is one of the few things I like about the college.
Sports: The football team of the university regularly win trophies at various tournaments.
If you are still convinced about joining this college then go ahead but I would certainly not suggest you for the same."
155,"Vels Institute of Science, Technology & Advanced Studies","Which is better, IMU Chennai or Vels University?","My cousin is from this institute, so I think I am eligible to answer your question.
It is a well-established institution with a well-qualified faculty and a placement track record ranging from 60% to 90%. According to the recent placement highlights the average CTC offered at the institute is 17 LPA. 
The university has all modern conveniences, such as air-conditioned classrooms/laboratories, a fine canteen, and a pleasant environment. 
However, you have to look out for expenses as if you know it is an expensive university with fewer than 210 days of classes every year. So if you can afford it, then you should definitely go for it."
155,"Vels Institute of Science, Technology & Advanced Studies",How many companies have visited at VEL Tech University for placement?,"The school of management at Vel Tech University is reputed among the management institutes in India.

161,Silicon University,Which is better: Silicon Institute of Technology or KIIT? Why?,"UIT Burdwan is not a good choice when compared to Silicon Institute of Technology. You should avoid going there. The following are the points to be considered.
UIT Burdwan is Government funded and affiliated with Burdwan University. But the intake of 60 undergraduate students is low.
It accepts only WBJEE ranks for admission.
The placement in UIT Burdwan is also poor. It offers limited internship opportunities for the students.
A few of the top recruiters in CSE include TCS, Infotech, Infosys, IBM, L&T, and more.
The placement statistics are below.
Lowest Salary INR 2.4 LPA
Average Salary INR 4 LPA
Highest Salary INR 8.5 LPA
Placement Percentage 50%
UIT Burdwan is not the best place to get admission. The curriculum is old, so college life seems like a time killer. However, if inclined towards CSE or IT branch, look for colleges in Bangalore. It is the Silicon Valley of India and a hub for major IT companies."
161,Silicon University,"Considering all aspects, which is better, VSSUT Burla vs SIT Bhubaneswar?","LNCT is one of Madhya Pradesh's best private institutes. I have a few friends from the institute and according to them, the CSE course offered is great. 
The well-trained faculty members strive to provide students with a high-quality education. The institute is synonymous with quality because of its world-class facilities, excellent infrastructure, well-equipped laboratories and libraries, and student-friendly campus.
The training and placement cell works closely with students and the administration to assist them to seek jobs in the companies of their preference. WIPRO, Cognizant, Amdocs, Infosys, and many others are among the major league companies. According to the recent placement highlights the average CTC offered at LNCT Bhopal is around 3-8 LPA. 
With good facilities and decent placement records, LNCT Bhopal is definitely a good choice for doing your CSE degree."

Sanskrit University is a University and because of which there is no need of AICTE approval, but the university is approved under UGC part 1 and part 2 as well as the university is accredited to all its regulatory body of the courses. 
For example programs like law are accredited to Bar Council of India, Pharmacy is accredited to Pharmacy Council of India, B.Sc. Agriculture is accredited to ICAR, etc. 
Sanskriti University is approved in all, you can check it on the official websites of the authorised bodies.
Therefore, Sanskriti University is approved by all the accrediting bodies and authorities.
Universities do not need any affiliation to AICTE; it is the accrediting body for the institutes. The university should be approved from the University Grants Commission which is mandatory for a registered University. Sanskrit University is approved under UGC."
163,Sanskriti University - [SU],How is Sanskriti University?,"One of my friends studied at Sanskriti University, according to her it is an average institution with very few facilities available for students.
The placement here is mediocre. Very few students get job opportunities through on-campus placements.
The college does not provide enough facilities, there is no AC in the campus buildings and the mess food is not up to the mark.
The faculty members are not well experienced in their fields and very few of them are permanent professors.
The management staff is not at all cooperative.
The labs are not updated with new machines or softwares, keeping them behind from the emerging and upcoming industry trends and events.
The academic curriculum is also not updated.
The library lacks good books and other study materials.
Overall, it is a very mediocre college with average facilities, so it is suggested that you look for other options and not settle with only this in mind."
163,Sanskriti University - [SU],Is Sanskriti University good for a B.Tech?,"Yes, Sanskriti University is one of the best engineering colleges in Northern India. It is very much popular among students for its B.Tech course.
Placements: 
About 95% of the students got selected through placements. 
The highest salary package offered was 4 LPA. 
The training and placement cell is responsible for every student to get placed in good reputed companies.
Infrastructure: 
The institute was awarded the best engineering institutions in UP as well as northern India. 
They have a huge library and a cafeteria. 
The entire campus is enabled with high-speed internet connectivity through Wi-Fi.
Faculty: 
Teachers are helpful and supportive. 
They are highly experienced in their dedicated fields. 
They make sure that the students are industry-ready, and with the help of the knowledge provided.
 Therefore, Sanskriti University is a really good option for pursuing a B.Tech degree."
164,Adamas University,What is some information about Adamas University?,"From the options given above, none of them are good. UEM Kolkata does not have good management at all. You will not find any good labs here. As far as ADAMAS is concerned, there is not much information available about it but my friends have said that is not that good either.
My suggestion to you would be to opt for computer science at either of these colleges. This is because pursuing core streams from either of these colleges will be of no help to you at all. 
If you end up doing CSE, you can secure a job at a top MNC or IT firm. Due to the demand of CSE and IT graduates nowadays, there are more chances to get a job here, than in any core industry.

165,Ganpat University - [GUNI],How is Ganpat University in Gujarat?,"I have a few friends who attend Ganpat University (ICT), Gujarat. According to them, the institute offers decent academics. The campus life at the institute is also enjoyable. However, if you are looking for decent placement opportunities, don’t join the institute. The placement cell of the institute isn’t effective in offering good placement offers. If you are looking for decent academics only you can choose the institute."
165,Ganpat University - [GUNI],How are the placements for computer graduates of Ganpat University?,"Ganpat University Mehsana offers a decent Megatronics course. As compared to other colleges in Gujarat, it has better labs and infrastructural facilities for the Mechanical and Mechatronics departments. 
But Ganpat University placement scenario is not that good. There is almost little to no placement for the Mechatronics branch. Although many companies come to the institute for placements, most prefer Mechanical students over Mechatronics students."
166,CEPT University,How good is CEPT University?,"CEPT University is an old and reputed university. It ranks among the top universities for architecture. It has great faculty and environment. The culture on the campus is quite friendly. You can easily approach the faculties. 
The campus is huge and well-equipped with up-to-date facilities and teaching methodology. The staff and student union on campus are also quite co-opearative."
166,CEPT University,Which college is better - SPA Delhi or CEPT university?,"SVNIT is theoretical research-based while CEPT is more practice-oriented. If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. further or if you would like to get placed on-campus, then SVNIT is your place.
After matching your requirements focus on excelling at GATE to get structural engineering getting into structural engineering at SVNIT.
If you choose CEPT then you will have to work hard to get a job. It is well known in all of Asia and has one of the best civil engineers. The faculty is highly qualified, its alumni are working in MNCs and most of them get annual trips abroad.
Lastly, if you are not from Ahmedabad you will have to stay at the CEPT hostel which is an awesome place to stay, as you will see for yourself if you so choose to be.
Be mindful of the fees because both SVNIT and Nirma charge more about the quality they provide."

I think it’s a bad idea to make a comparison among colleges. The college in which you study does not matter much if you are passionate about pursuing your interests and goals. Every college has its own way of standing out.
Some of the pros of CVR are:
CVR’s infrastructure is well up to the mark. Every department has the required number of labs, including computer labs as well. CVR also boasts of Apple labs.
Through technical and cultural fests, hackathons, competitions, contests, and projects students are given multiple opportunities to show their talents and prowess. They can also be effective learning experiences.
CVR boasts of amazing placements too. The placement office expects manners, the attitude of learning, and sincerity. The placement training officer of the college will try everything to get you placed.
The CVR is an autonomous college and is affiliated with JNTU. The schedule is informed in the beginning of the session. You will appear for two midterms before appearing for the final exams every semester.
Apart from the academics, there are clubs for management, techno-management, art, music etc. So, if you are curious, you can obviously check out some of these fields. The alumni are very helpful so they will always be available for any assistance."

Overall, it is a great university with a unique curriculum and a good placement record."
179,Shoolini University,How is shoolini university?,"Shoolini University has good placement records especially for the B.Com (Hons) and MBA degrees offered by the School of Business Management and Liberal Arts. Some of the companies that offered jobs to the students of this school are
Hindustan Unilever
ICICI Bank
Bank of America
LG
HDFC Bank
Yes Bank
Airtel
Reliance Jio
Oberoi Group
Genpact
Apart from that, the various biotech programs offered by the School of Biotechnology and the pharmacy programs offered by the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences are also pretty good.
Talking of the engineering departments, then apart from Mechanical Engineering and a little bit of CSE, the placements are average to not so good. Except for a few good companies, there are hardly any good quality placements. The packages are low and the jobs offered are also not core engineering.
Except for management, biotech and pharmacy all other placements are not good. The faculty at these departments are also better than other departments. The university website claims 100% placements for the students with the highest package being 15 LPA for the year 2020."
179,Shoolini University,How is the placement of Shoolini University?,"My cousin did his B.Tech from Shoolini University. Here are his insights. 
They mainly focus on these few branches - MBA, B.Com, BIOTECH.
The management system is not good at all and you will see an increase in certain charges every semester.
Regarding the faculty, the aforementioned branches have the best faculty in the university, and in other remaining branches don’t have that good faculty. 
The labs don’t have adequate equipment. University has old technique machines and also not have some major lab that some engineer is looking for like material science lab for a mechanical engineer.
The students face so many problems for placement and internship programs. Only 40% of students are placed, that's not even half.
The fees are very expensive as compared to the level of facilities they provide and in comparison to other universities /colleges in the same category. 
Therefore, if you are looking for a good college for pursuing B.Tech, Shoolini University might not be a great choice. Apart from focused branches, cleanliness, natural environment, and friendly peers, there is not much to mention about the institute."
179,Shoolini University,Is Shoolini University of Biotechnology & Management Sciences a good choice for a B. Tech in Biotechnology?,"For an MBA, Shoolini University is one of the best educational institutes in Northern India. It offers good academics. The course structure includes various personality development programs. The faculties and the management staffs are co-operative. Shoolini University placement highlights show the average CTC to be around INR 6.5 LPA. Times of India, ICICI Prudential, HDFC, etc. are among the major recruiters for the institute."
180,Banasthali Vidyapith,What is your review of Banasthali University?,"My sister chose to pursue her graduation and post-graduation from Banasthali Vidyapith. She enjoyed all of the benefits of staying on campus, such as participating in extracurricular activities, being autonomous, and so on. 
Check the following points for a brief review of Banasthali University:
In terms of academics, Banasthali University has a lot to offer. It is a strong contender in many of them - computer science, MBA, Home Science, Literature and Language, Social Sciences, Mathematics, and so on. 
It also has adequate sports facilities, but they can be improved. Banasthali University does not have separate coaches for many sports.
The only thing that would bother you is the strength of the classrooms. At times, it will be completely unacceptable
Banasthali VIdyapith fee structure is also inexpensive, despite any financial difficulties, you can easily cover the costs of most of the courses.
Overall, Banasthali University offers a wonderful experience. Despite its flaws as an institution, it has many characteristics that make it wonderful and valuable."
181,Amity University,Is Amity University Jaipur good for an MBA?,"Amity University Jaipur is one of the top-ranked private universities in India offering more than 70 programs in the area of Science, Commerce, and Arts. Its main aim is to provide a world-class education in modern as well as traditional teaching methods so that the students can explore their skills around the world.
Infrastructure 
The university is very good at infrastructure having all facilities such as;
Sufficient space for indoors games (table tennis,) and outdoors games( cricket, volleyball, basketball, etc.)
Free Wi-Fi network 
Departmental store, cafeteria, ATM, medical store, and many more.
Faculty 
More than 850 faculty members are for all the Departments. They are highly experienced with efficient skills as per their field of study.

The graphical representation shown above is just to give the level of excellence at infrastructure, faculty, academics, hostel, and placement."
181,Amity University,"How good is Amity University, Jaipur?","One of my friends is currently residing in Jaipur and he recommends RNB Global University, Bikaner for higher education.
Though the quality of education at Amity University Jaipur is not so high and placements are very poor, he took admission to RNB Global University. It has one of the finest infrastructure and rendering world-class facilities one can see on the campus.
The faculty is highly qualified with Ph.D. degrees from top universities around the world. The interaction level between faculty and students is also very high. There's communication both ways, which is a key aspect.
It is situated on a 300-acre campus in the city of Bikaner and assures an all-around development of the students with various student-led activities, cross-college electives for students, and regular visits by eminent personalities with a lot of guest lectures."
182,CMR University - [CMRU],How is CMR University?,"CMR University does not have good reviews. I have a few friends at the institute and the institute has not lived up to their expectations. 
The whole college gives you lazy vibes and the faculty members are mostly not available. Instead of taking classes, they will ask you to write essays on random topics just for the sake of attendance.
The infrastructure is also not up-to-date. You won’t find the books you need at the library. 
There are no extracurricular activities, fests, or any events. My friend changed institute after 6 months, once he got to know the institute keeps the original documents for the entire period of the degree.
My friend wanted to pursue a triple major in Psychology, Literature, and Journalism. He was told it is a good option by the counselor and placement officer. But just within a week, he was informed that Journalism is just a side subject. 
Here’s a statistical insight of the institute.
Highest CTC
18 LPA
Major Recruiters 
State Street, Urban Ladder, EY, Amazon, HP, TCS, etc. 
Fee Range
75,000-2.25 lakhs
Comparably it is better to pursue a degree from Mumbai University, the quality of education there will be similar to that of CMR University but the course fee is a lot less. It will be better if you reach out to the alumni and the current students of the university to know the real scenario and make a decision based on that."
182,CMR University - [CMRU],"Which is better for B.Tech. CSE: Presidency University, Bangalore or CMR University, Bangalore or Christ University Faculty of Engineering, Bangalore?","As the question is specific about the CSE branch, Acharya Institute of Technology ( AIT ) would be a better option compared to CMR University in regard to placements. AIT was established a lot earlier than CMR University and functions as an autonomous body, while AIT is affiliated to VTU and ACITE norms.
Affiliation:
Being a newly established and Autonomous institute CMR wouldn’t compete against AIT when it comes to placements and campus opportunities.
AIT is not the only college with VTU affiliation, but also the Dayanand Sagar Academy of Technology and Management (DSTAM). What makes DSTAM standout among these three is the number of placements it offers each year. With consistent placement records ever since its establishment, DSTAM has grown a lot during the past few years in terms of its reputation.
Admission:
To be eligible for admission to Acharya Institute of Technology, one must appear in CET conducted by the Institute. The final selection will be based on the marks obtained in the entrance examination.
Dayanand Sagar also conducts a Common Entrance Test for admission in B.E. programs. Students must have obtained at least 45% marks in their intermediate examination with PCM.
Placements:
The average package of AIT would hover around 3.2 LPA where DSTAM would go up to 3.5- 4 LPA.
Many top IT companies and few product-based software companies visit the DSTAM campus for recruitments each year.
Pre-final year students of the colleges receive a lot of support from Alumni network inform of internship and job offers in their startups.
Fee Structure:
Speaking of affordability both CMR and DSTAM cots much less than AIT, the former being just around 1 lakh per year, and the later is nearly 3 lakh per year.
The fee need to be paid for AIT for the four-year degree is almost 12 lakhs.
We can say that both AIT and DSTAM would be good and compelling options to opt for when looking for computer science admission. To add further the campus of DSTAM is right in the heart of the city.
So, to conclude if placements are of high priority ( which of course should be for CSE ), then Dayanand Sagar is a clear choice, but if the fee structure doesn’t match your comfort then AIT should be the immediate choice."

183,Bangalore Institute of Technology - [BIT],Which is better for CSE: the RNSIT or the Bangalore Institute of Technology?,"When compared to other colleges in Karnataka, BIT placements are much better. One of my friends completed his BE in Civil Engineering (2016) and got placed in Brigade.
Placements: 
The institute witnessed 50% placements in 2019 and received companies like Larsen and Toubro, Gammon, Wipro, and Accenture. A couple of construction companies visit for the placement process as well. 
Around 15-20 students get placed with core companies. Other branches do have a much better placement rate. For instance, it was 100% for CSE, ISE, and ECE branches.
However, Civil Engineering has more scope off-campus. Govt. sectors offer the highest number of jobs to Civil Engineering students. 
Civil engineering students may have to start with a lower CTC than other branches but there are no saturation points.
The placement statistics for Civil Engineering in recent years at BIT are as follows.
Average CTC
6.5 LPA
Median CTC
4 LPA

  The trend is in the favour of Civil Engineers and there's a huge demand for CE in the industry, which was not so a decade ago. So, if you are genuinely interested in Civil then you should go for it."

It is a good option if you just want a degree. Here are some of the perks of joining the institute. 
There are over 15 clubs at SMIT. The club culture is quite good at the institute. If you want you can start your own club too. 
It has a great geographic landscape. There are awesome places that you can visit.
It helps in the all-round development of students. 
Overall SMIT is not a bad option for distance learning."

188,Chandigarh Group of Colleges - [CGC] Landran,How are the placements in CGC Landran?,"A few of my friends are CGC Landran alumni and their rutin at the institute was somewhat like the following. 
Students lined in a queue near washrooms early in the morning at 06:30-07:00 AM. 
Reaching mess for breakfast.
Getting ready. Tuesdays and Thursdays are meant for uniform/casual.
4 lectures to be attended from 09:15-12:05 PM (Group 1)
5 lectures to be attended from 09:15-12:55 PM (Group 2)

07:30-09:00 PM is dinner time.
You can wander around the campus, but make sure you report before 10 PM.
Next morning, you have the same routine which continues till Friday. College is off on Saturdays and Sundays. This routine that I have mentioned goes on for the next 3 years. Till then, you'd be categorized as seniors and prone to mass-bunks. Plus when you're in your 4th year of college, your timings would just be from 09:30 to 02:00 PM.
Once a year the institute celebrates Parivartan fest, sports day, Baishaki festival, etc. Each branch also has its separate fests in which students from different branches can take part. All in all life at CGC Landran will be quite fun."

191,Institute Technology & Management - [ITM],How many NITs are better than IITM Gwalior?,"Your question is not relevant because even new colleges are growing fast in terms of curriculum, culture, and placements. You cannot deny the fact that only the top 7-8 NITs are doing than IIITM Gwalior. It is just below NIT Bhopal in terms of CS/IT education.
Apart from that, NITs offer core branches too but IIITM Gwalior only offers CSE/IT so the comparison would be based on only these.
For Coding Culture - It would be better than almost all NITs as this is based on their participation in ICPC (Olympic for coding).
For Curriculum - IIITs have a better curriculum than NITs in general and they are more updated. Like NIT Kurukshetra, Computer engineering is very much focused on hardware.
Placement Scenario - IIITM Gwalior is equal to NIT Kurukshetra having an average placement.

193,Malla Reddy Engineering College - [MREC],Is Malla Reddy Engineering College a good school to attend?,"One of my sisters studied in MRCET. According to her, MRCET is much better than MREC, which is the first campus belonging to the Malla Reddy group. Even though it was built first, MRCET still shines through because of its faculty, infrastructure, and curriculum. It is now an autonomous college as well. 
Here is what all you would like to know further-
In terms of infrastructure, there are separate blocks for each batch and department.
The faculty at MRCET is dedicated to delivering lectures. They make sure that you understood the topics discussed. 
Resources are shared at the end of each class and external links are given too in order to improve your knowledge.
The college has excellent facilities for sports like cricket, football, basketball, and table tennis.

In this College, girls have a dress code. They have to wear a dupatta and a kurta on regular days, and in the labs, shoes and a dupatta are a must. 
The college is not so liberal when it comes to enjoyment. 
Faculties force the students to come to college to attend classes. They judge you based on your marks. 
Students who score in the top 10 are considered to be the best while the others are considered dumb.
With a rank of 33,000, you can get into a better college. It is suggested to not go for Malla Reddy Engineering College, as it is very strict, especially for girls."
193,Malla Reddy Engineering College - [MREC],"How is Malla Reddy Engineering College for girls in Hyderabad? I've gotten a rank of 33k, and I don't want a management seat there. Will I get in there?","One of my friends is an alumnus of Malla Reddy. He passed out recently and according to him the management fees for ECE were 8 lakhs.
He advises joining Malla Reddy college if you are really passionate about engineering, because the image of doing engineering that is imprinted on our mind from society, media and movies is not 100% true. Engineering days are not as happy or relaxed as it is portrayed. If you have a good percentage till 4th year you will be placed in IT companies for tech support, system management, or admin-related posts and if you are not placed then they will send you to amazon or uber BPO jobs interviews in college.
So, the institute if you are genuinely interested in engineering. As you can simply get placed in tech support jobs in Dell, Amazon, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, etc. through walk-in interviews. So, don’t waste your parent’s money or your precious 4 years unless you are sure."
193,Malla Reddy Engineering College - [MREC],What is the management fee for an ECE at Malla Reddy?,"No, it is not a suitable option for B.tech in aeronautical engineering. A friend of mine has studied there and notified me about its drawbacks. He strongly suggested me not to take admissions to that college
There is no separate branch for aeronautical engineering. You won't be able to get the required education and the appropriate syllabus if your aim is higher studies in this field.
The quality of education at Malla Reddy Engineering College is not satisfactory. The faculty isn’t helpful nor is the reputation to draw renowned companies for placements. Even the most brilliant students struggle to get a good salary from the companies that recruited them.
The degree from this college won't be of much help to you while aiming for high-profile jobs with a strong salary package.
If one is keen on pursuing B.tech in aeronautical engineering then it would be advisable to look at any of the IITs, NITs, or the other top 20 colleges. 
In the year 2020, no aeronautical based companies visited the campus for recruitment which led to a zero placement rate.
The few students who were selected during placements were taken in by the non-core companies.
The students were thus left with zero option but to indulge themselves in other streams of engineering. 
Regardless of this, their starting salary was 2.5 LPA. The salary was not at all satisfactory.
Let's take a look at the factual table to get a better understanding of the situation –
Placement rate for Aeronautical Engineering branch (2020)
0%
Placement rate for other engineering branches (non-core) (2020)
65%-70%
Average package salary (2020)
>2LPA and <6LPA
Quality of teachers appointed
Average (Some of them are good, some are not)
Curriculum
Needs improvement; Modifications required in terms of the current requirement of this field.
Therefore, keeping the above discussions in mind Malla Reddy College is not favorable for pursuing B.tech in aeronautical engineering. One should concentrate on getting admitted to either IITs or NITs, even if one has to wait and prepare for a year or more."

198,Madras Institute of Technology- [MIT],What is the best placement story at Madras Institute of Technology (MIT)?,"The best placement story would be that of my friend's brother and here's why - he is everything you can imagine. He has been a very multidimensional person with active participation in workshops and extracurriculars, he was the class representative and is a topper as well with a 9.2 CGPA.
The story goes somewhat like this -
In the middle of September, the placement count of the production department was 1/55. Only one student was placed with CitiCorp. Following this, Titan, Hyundai, and Caterpillar came for recruitment as well.
After five days of presentations, tests, GD, and interviews those who had applied for Caterpillar assembled at the CEG campus' CUIC auditorium, where students were given technical and aptitude tests to solve.
My friend's brother qualified up to GD but wasn't able to crack it. However, he wasn't disappointed and the next day took the Titan online test in the IT Department but the result got delayed and the company was not reachable.
Although to his surprise, Caterpillar again came for recruitment along with M&M and Vedanta. This was probably the last opportunity for all to get placed with a core company.
These time marks from the previous rounds were being considered by Caterpillar and he has reached up to GD. He became busy preparing for that even while traveling or eating and did make it to the personal interview.
He recollected all the basics of engineering and was ready with his resume points and by 6 pm he made it to the job with his perseverance. I hope this inspires you to make the best of your time."

198,Madras Institute of Technology- [MIT],Who are some of the best professors at Madras Institute of Technology (MIT)? And why?,"My friend studied at MIT in 2013 and he says there are many reputable names from different departments like Prof. K Jeyaraman in the Aeronautical Engineering department, or Dr. PK Kanagasabapathy from the Instrumentation Engineering department, or Dr. A Rajadurai who was the former dean of MIT- he was an expert in Metallurgy and is one of the best professors owned by MIT. 
Nevertheless, because my friend has his personal favorites, I'd write about them here -
Late Prof. VK Narayanan was dedicated to his profession and his students. His room was next to the internet room on the admin floor. My friend used to converse with him on any topic necessary.
It was because of him that he discovered KB Chandrasekar, the same KBC of the AU KBC research centre where my friend is an employee now. He forsook TCS to join there.
There have been innumerable instances where my friend was guided and helped by prof KVN. 
One such incident is of the day when someone from the All India Radio came to him to introduce a new program to him on Information Technology. 
He had approached him to ask him for lectures on computers to be relayed on AIR, and Prof Mathiazhagan had already done the first episode; but Prof KVN calmly made him understand that he should give such opportunities to young students.
He pointed at my friend and highlighted his erudition on knowledge to do with the internet, which landed him with 20+ episodes.
Not only this, he once helped a student to apply to foreign universities and she landed in a good US university, one more student with his help in association with my friend got a job with Blackberry and now lives in San Francisco. 
Once my friend wanted to build a website for MIT and guess who provided all the support - Prof. KVN did. He learned HTML, found a domain name, and created official MIT emails for all the staff members.
He had been a professor, friend, and guide to my friend."
198,Madras Institute of Technology- [MIT],What is it like to study in MIT (Madras Institute of Technology)?,"MIT has been one of the best experiences for my cousin’s sister. It is a place to learn, grow and develop fond memories. Following are some unique things about MIT -
India's 11th president and aerospace scientist Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam used to teach here at MIT and won the heart of each student.
The support of seniors is priceless. During your first year, you will be constantly guided and supported by your seniors and this will inculcate a sense of goodwill in you as well towards your juniors in return.
The faculty is extraordinary. Not all but those few who are, are so good at the subjects they teach and ways in which they offer support that you'd remember them all your life. One such honorable mention is Prof Jothilingam of PT. The way he helped students with studies and opportunities was unparalleled. 
Then comes the MITAFEST. One of the most loved and awaited college fests of the year. When the events begin, you'll feel all immersed in the celebration and festivities which follow. Definitely a recipe for delectable memories in the future.
The campus is serene and compact, it's not the largest, nor are there thousands of students. Rather you'll find yourself in a close-knit community."
198,Madras Institute of Technology- [MIT],What is the best ragging experience you have had at Madras Institute Of Technology?,"My cousin went to MIT and faced it during his first semester. His seniors from the third-year department caught him red-handed one night while he got late in getting back to his hostel during the weekend. He arrived at 9 and was taken by them to the railway track from Chrompet to Pallavaram. 
They walked and asked him about his personal and academic backgrounds. After this, the popular question came up, which was about the number of girls in his class.
After reaching Pallavaram, they all bought tickets for themselves for the beach station but didn't pay for him. When the train arrived after ten minutes, they asked him to yell out some gibberish at the station, as part of the ragging.
The people on the station were clearly amused.
Ragging is an MIT tradition during the first year of college and then when the seniors are graduating, students are asked to do what they like to dance, sing, run, wrestle, walk, travel, bring gifts, etc. This is not scary at all, rather fun to do. My cousin faced similar incidents twice or thrice, not any harsh form of ragging but experiential stuff, which made him cherish memories of that time."
198,Madras Institute of Technology- [MIT],"What is your opinion about studying at Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai?","I have one of my cousins studying at Madras Institute of Technology. So here, is what it feels like to be at MIT.
You are going to learn a lot from MIT and gain experience about how to be social and develop relations. The classes don’t run from morning to evening. You will have a lot of free time to explore the campus. You can either go and watch movies, hang out with friends, join cultural activities, etc. For class attendance, if you have above 65% attendance then it will also work.
Syllabus: MIT teaches an old syllabus, which is not of use in the practical world. You can read books and attend OCW lectures to gain knowledge. 
Faculty: MIT faculty is not very promising. They don’t elaborate on their notes, neither give an answer to a student's question.
Extra-Curricular Activities: MIT first-year students have to join NCC, NSO, YRC. All the coaches and mentors will show and teach you the toughest lesson of your life. 
Activities: You can also get involved in team projects or co-curricular activities, where you will learn about team management, leadership, peer relationship, stress management, etc. You also get to know your college mates. And might become friends with someone. 
Internships: You must make sure that you learn something out of these internships. Otherwise, it will not be fruitful in your learning. Most of the time, time spent during these internships are better than doing the internship itself.
Projects: MIT projects are not very challenging. Even if you make a basic quadcopter, they will make you believe it is the best you can do. Hence, MIT academic quality detonated by passing time. 
Therefore, MIT will make you only pass the college. You are not allowed to ask questions or take any new project in hand. It may be good for you if you are adamant to work hard."

Students of BIT Patna have shown a lot of participation and enthusiasm in the field of robotics. Some students have even gone to NASA from BIT Patna.
In the top engineering branches, BIT Patna guarantees 100% placement to its students. Although Nirma University is a good institute, it does not offer any such guarantee in placement.
Therefore, BIT Patna is a good choice for students, especially in branches like CSE, IT, and ECE, which has decent placement records over the last few years."
203,Marwadi University - [MU],Which is better: Chandigarh University or Marwadi University?,"Ahmedabad University offers world-class facilities. It has also collaborated with foreign universities. The university follows project-based learning. It also conducts research seminars for the students.
However, Marwadi University has more than 500 faculty members who are experts in their respective fields. More than a hundred of them have degrees from institutes like the IITs, NITs, BITS, VIT, and even Stanford University. It offers more than 50 courses under 12 programs. This makes it one of the best universities.
Marwadi University is visited by a number of top companies. Some of them are Byju’s, LG, Just Dial, Hettich, TCS, LG, Amazon, etc. The highest package offered by Marwadi University was INR 12 LPA and the average package was INR 2.4 LPA.
Both universities have earned a great amount of reputation all over the country. However, when we compare these two universities from an overall perspective, Marwadi University tops in terms of campus, academic performance, and extracurricular activities."

Key Highlights:
There is a lack of proper faculties, especially experienced teachers in the institute. Mostly, faculties read out previous year's notes as a part of their teaching. On the contrary, there are some good faculties who deliver productive lectures.
Students face different kinds of harassment inside the campus. There are instances of bad behavior from the management and other staff in the college.
Some students are of a selfish nature and jealous, which creates a bad impact. There is a 60:40 North and South Indian ratio inside the campus.
The campus does not have a proper canteen and a library.
The campus is too far from Bangalore city, with no proper transportation facility from the Bangalore Municipal Transport Corporation.
There are no well-equipped labs for proper teaching and practical subjects.
Students face an utter lack of recreation due to the unavailability of entertainment activities during the college days.
Too many hectic class schedules are placed by the departments.
There is a convention of collecting money from students for every event, which is not a good sign for the institute.
An unorganized college campus is a problem that is faced generally by freshers.
Overall, it is an institute with a below-average rating. Students usually don’t prefer AMC Engineering College. You can go to other private engineering colleges in Bangalore."
209,AMC Engineering College - [AMC],"Which college is better for ISE: RNSIT, CMRIT or A.M.C engineering college?","First, you should stop considering A.M.C Engineering College, if you are going to compare it with institutes like RNSIT or CMRIT.

Placement (Winning Institute- RNSIT):
Though placements primarily depend on the candidate’s dedication and hard work, RNSIT has a greater edge over good opportunities in the industry.
RNSIT and CMRIT have an almost similar level of growth. But to some extent, RNSIT is preferred over CMRIT due to the overall placement scenario, availability of companies and packages offered.
Key highlights - RNSIT:
RNSIT is famous for its teaching faculty, the way they help students and encourage them in the curriculum and placement.
Going with the fame too, RNSIT is preferred. Among the three institutes, RNSIT has the lowest closing ranks in COMEDK and KCET.
Ranking-wise, RNSIT leads in the race due to the lowest overall fees and a good amount of facilities offered.
So, it is evident that RNSIT is the most preferred institute for ISE among the three."

211,Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology - [MAIT],Is MAIT Delhi a good college to study CS? What are the placement stats? How good is the crowd there?,"When it comes to MAIT, it may not have the same coding environment as other colleges like MSIT or BVP. However, it is important to note that things are changing at MAIT, and there are opportunities for students to participate in coding competitions, Hackathons, Competitive Programming, Open Source, and more. 
The availability of professors with research backgrounds is limited, and more could be done to expand opportunities for serious project work.
The course curriculum at MAIT and IPU is outdated and may include subjects that are not directly relevant to CSE students.
Placements at MAIT are strong, with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, and Accenture visiting the campus.
More than 80% of students get placed, with some students receiving offers as high as 42 LPA from Microsoft.
It's important to note that many placements listed by others also include off-campus opportunities obtained through individual skills and efforts.
CS and IT students shouldn't have to worry about the crowd, especially if in the first shift, as the current boys-to-girl ratio in IT are approximately 2:1.
You will get an overview of the college from the video below"
211,Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology - [MAIT],"What should I choose, MAIT, MSIT, or BVP?","USICT has a good placement record. Some of the major recruiters at the institute are Nagarro, Impetus, Infogain, Infosys, Winsol, etc. And there are some companies that include Cognizant, TechMahindra that invite sit-in pool placements.
Other than that, one of the good things about USICT is that almost every student got placed from the CSE and IT departments.
Here is a brief highlight of the recent placement statistics at these institutes.

211,Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology - [MAIT],USICT average package? Is it better than mait and igdtuw?,"There are a total of about 12 seats in the first shift of management quota admissions in MAIT, IPU, and a total of about 6 seats in the second shift in each branch of management quota in MAIT. 
In order to take up a management quota seat, you should have connections with any of the trustees of the college. Moreover, you must contact the college administrative block for more details. 
In addition to that, you must keep visiting the college on a regular basis and visit the college's official website frequently in order to get updated for every information. The management quota seats are limited and almost get filled up faster in the month of July."
211,Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology - [MAIT],"What is the process of management quota admissions in MAIT, IPU?","The college is situated near my home and I have often interacted with the students. The following points are clearly based on my experience with students: 
Location: The nearest metro station is at Rithala from Rohini PSP, around 7 km away. You can go to Rithala if you wish to go to Metro Walk or City Centre Mall, etc.
Societies: There aren’t that many active societies in the college, just the one called Ayaam which is the dramatics and funk in motion dance society. A lot of mechanical students prefer to take part in Jatayu but this is only available for students from 3rd year onwards. Apart from this, you will mostly be attending lectures non-stop.
Sports: There is an indoor badminton court and a fitness centre that only hostellers can use. Most other sports are non-existent except the volleyball team. There is just a namesake sports week that takes place in the winter.
Fest: MAIT’s fest has definitely improved over the past few years and these are the only 2-3 days of college you will enjoy the most. They do not attract big celebrities, but it is a start.
Professors: You will find professors from both extremes, some ready to impart knowledge to students whereas others who won’t care.
Crowd: The crowd is here is definitely better than that at IPU. The college canteen is also decent but food outside the campus is definitely better.
Life: Your workload is not going to reduce in college, so if you are looking for respite, you won’t find it. There will be lab work, assignments and project files to submit. Moreover, IPU’s curriculum is easy to crack and has remained stagnant over the years. You will not find much growth here. NSIT, DTU, and IIIT are much better in this matter.
If you are looking for college life, go to NSIT and DTU because life can get boring at MAIT. You will need to find friends who are willing to be there for you for your four years at MAIT otherwise it could get very boring."
211,Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology - [MAIT],How is MAIT Delhi?,"You will get a friendly environment and culture to grow in MAIT. It doesn’t offer all the branches as lower-ranked government colleges. The culture here helps a student to develop the skills required after entering into the field.
One of my friends, who pursued his engineering in the CSE branch from MAIT, told me that no other branch than CSE gives high placements when compared with IPU government colleges. This plays a major role in getting placed in top companies. Many of his seniors have cracked CAT and got into IIMs.
It doesn’t matter from which college you are getting your degree, what matters is your goal and working hard to live it. There are many others, who have passed out from the government. colleges and are placed in top-notch companies. This happened because of the strong determination you have inside you. So just work hard and move on."
212,Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology - [MSIT],What is your review of Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology?,"MSIT is well known for its good placement record. The packages are generally mentioned or are told in the email by the company. 
For IT or CS, most of the students get placed provided they don’t have any backlogs and successfully cleared the written examination. Most of the students get placed in companies like Infosys, Accenture, etc. There are good companies too, but their selection process is difficult, which is the case for most institutes. 
Here are the placement highlights for the academic year 2020.
Average CTC

212,Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology - [MSIT],"What should I choose, MAIT, MSIT, or BVP?","One of my friends is currently pursuing B.Tech at CIC DU and he applied for MSIT IPU as well. Firstly CIC is not a college and more of an Innovation Centre or Entrepreneurship Cell whereas MSIT is a college that uses the same mechanism procedure.

The difference lies in the approach of how they educate and guide students. 
CIC DU being an innovation hub is focused on different aspects of research, startups, and the linkage to the real-life aspects of the problem and their suitable solution. 
It mainly focuses on the practical aspect and encourages knowledge to be used in daily tasks. 
They have world-class labs which are better than almost any college. It has a well-developed Robotics lab with 3D printing which stands out. 
There is continuous funding from Delhi University for all the research work, startups, projects, and everything. 
During summers compulsory internships are said to be done so as to give better exposure to the students for the lying problems. 
When compared to other colleges, the syllabus is a lot more than normal colleges. Students have the task of at least 6 projects per semester with learning more than 5 languages and different simulations at a time like Scilab, Matlab, C++, etc. 
CIC might not have a placement cell that backs you up with projects and careers but if you work hard independently there, you can definitely secure a job."
212,Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology - [MSIT],How is the Maharaja Surajmal Institute for pursuing a BBA?,"Most of my friends have studied here at Maharaja Surajmal Institute and they were not very happy with the college. Following points are based on their experience:
The first day is usually very average and you might face difficulty in getting to the classrooms.
There will be an introduction session and usually most of the students are not very happy to get admission in that college.
A documentation process will also take place regarding the submission of fees which will take around 2-3 hours.
The crowd at the college is not good and you will find most of them involved in bad habits.
The faculties of this college are well experienced and qualified. They will help you in getting a lot of knowledge.
There is a compulsory rule of having 75% attendance in every semester and you may get failed if your attendance falls below 65%.
The students of this college and the seniors are quite helpful and friendly. You will not be getting any grooming sessions and personality development sessions in this college.
Overall the college is good and time will pass in this college very soon. You will have some beautiful memories of this college and you will enjoy it a lot along with your studies."

213,Panimalar Engineering College,Is Panimalar Engineering College good?,"If you're planning to attend this college, there are certain things you need to know to survive. While the food and some good faculty members can be helpful, they are quite rare. However, here are some things that you may need to endure:
Strict Rules: The college has a strict rule against any talk of the opposite sex, even if it's about your siblings or relatives. You can expect to face severe consequences if you violate this rule.
Formal Dress Code: The dress code is formal for boys, and girls are not allowed to wear leggings or any modern dressing styles.
Poor Quality of Teaching: The quality of teaching in this college is highly poor. You may pass the exams and even secure a good grade with the notes they provide, but the knowledge you gain is minimal.
No Respect for Human Rights: All forms of human rights are thrown out the window. If you have a beard, you will face discrimination and may be ostracized.
No Value for Student Curiosity: The college does not value student curiosity or enthusiasm. You may find yourself struggling to find opportunities to explore your interests.
Industrial Visits for Namesake: Industrial visits are just for the sake of it, and you may not gain any real-world knowledge or experience.
Symposium and Conferences for Namesake: The same applies to symposiums and conferences. They are only conducted for the sake of it and may not be beneficial in terms of learning.
Co-education for Namesake: The college claims to be co-educational, but in reality, it may not be. You may not find many opportunities for interaction with the opposite gender.
No Scope for Research: Research opportunities are minimal, and you may find yourself redoing existing projects repeatedly, which can be pointless.
In summary, while you may get an engineering degree in your respective field, you may not be able to become an engineer inside this campus."

218,Acropolis Institute of Technology & Research - [AITR],"Is doing engineering from SGSITS Indore with BM, IP, or ET from IET-DAVV better than taking CSE from Acropolis?","It depends on what you expect as the final outcome from your degree. If you are looking for just a degree, SGSITS is a good choice. But doing engineering just for the sake of it does not make sense. You should figure out what branch you want to study in before making any decisions.
BM and IP:
These two will not fetch you that much capital since the placement options are limited. Your chances will only increase if you are from an IIT.
CS:
Computer Science Engineering is the most reputed among students. It will fetch quite a decent package but you will have to work for it on your own, irrespective of which institute you choose. 
ET:
ET is a branch that can prove to be quite fruitful for you. Placements are really good to a certain level and you are bound to cop some of the top ones if you study seriously. 
Choosing a branch is the most crucial step and you should decide that, on your own."
218,Acropolis Institute of Technology & Research - [AITR],"Which is better for CSE, LNCT Bhopal or Acropolis Indore?","Having to know some people studying in these colleges and after reading some reviews online, I can say that market calculations for placements might have changed. But I could assure you that any of them would give solid infrastructure, reasonable learning experience, and plenty of opportunity for placement. 
Herewith I'm briefly differentiating all the colleges you mentioned :

Highest Package 8-10 LPA 7-8 LPA 9 PA
Average Package  INR 3.3 LPA INR 4.5 LPA INR 3.5-4 LPA
Choose one that meets your needs, taking into account other aspects such as costs, distance, etc. But it is better to take LNCT as your first preference at private school and to obtain entry in IT or CS out of the 1994 seats available."
218,Acropolis Institute of Technology & Research - [AITR],Which is better LNCT Bhopal Acropolis Indore or IPS Indore for the IT/CS branch?,"The main campus of LNCT in Bhopal would be the best option. However, if you want to join the LNCT campus that is not the main one, then AITR Indore is a good options.
In the placement drive held in LNCY Bhopal in 2021, the highest package was offered by Microsoft and it was an offer of INR 44 LPA. The top recruiters of the students are Capgemini, Cognizant, TCS, etc and they offer packages ranging from INR 3 to 8 LPA.
In the case of AITR Indore, the company that recruited the maximum number of students is TCS, followed by Blazeclan Technology and Capgemini. The highest package offered is INR 8 LPA and the average package is INR 3.8 LPA."

219,Quantum University,Is Sharda University better than Quantum University?,"My friend from school used to be a student of Quantum University. She completed her MBA in finance and secured a lucrative job at Yes Bank with a package of 10 LPA. 
Students even get placed in companies like Mahindra, Emson, Genpact, Oracle, Vivo, and Flipkart with packages even higher.
The campus is visited by a number of big names for the purpose of offering jobs to its students. 
The highest package that was offered was as high as 14 LPA. 
The alumni network of Quantum University is pretty extensive but only in India, unfortunately. The same cannot be said about the alumni network in the case of overseas.
More than 130 companies visit the campus for granting placement. The reason for such renown is because the university boasts of a placement record of 100% which it owes to its quality of education which is high and strong industry interface. 
The Assured Placements MBA Program, or (APMP) has recently been started by the university which assures that the students are placed in jobs at the time of completion of their course."
220,SAGE University,"What are the things I have to know about SAGE University, Indore?","SAGE University isn’t a good option for pursuing your studies. Here are some points that may help you in making your decision. 
It is located in the outskirts of Indore, so transportation will be a problem. 
The faculty base isn’t up to the mark.
The administration and the management aren’t very cooperative.
The syllabus followed at the university is a bit different from the other universities. So, once you join the university, you will have difficulty migrating to other colleges."
220,SAGE University,"What is the best university, Medi-Caps University or Sage University in Indore, MP?","For engineering, SAGE University, Indore is average at best. In Indore, there are other better institutes that offer engineering degrees. 
If you are interested in pursuing an engineering degree then you should prefer Govt. colleges. Although many govt. College isn’t that good, you won’t have the pressure of maintaining a certain percentage of attendance. That way you can better use your time in other things like coaching for competitive examinations, software classes,  etc."

All admissions to the university from 2010 to 2013 were declared completely illegal. However, the ban has been now removed and students have taken admission to the university. 
The High Court of Meghalaya has cleared all doubts and allegations. The university is now fully functional. 
As of recently, the university has been approved by UGC but not AICTE. It has been approved by the Distance Education Council as well. 
You can consider doing a UG degree from here as UGC approval is enough for a legitimate degree. But, there have been a lot of incidences where the college has given out and forged fake degrees.
You can try contacting the All Jaintia Youth Welfare Organization which has a clearer idea about the university. Overall, you probably should look for other options as compared to this one and save yourself from potential fraud."

This university is a good place if you want to prepare for the GATE examinations. It follows the exact syllabus for GATE and engineering services.
The pattern of teaching at Navrachana University is different from that of Gujarat Technological University (GTU). You will be asked questions in any pattern in the examination. You will not be asked to follow any standard books but a lot of reference books instead.
Following is the pattern of examination followed by Navrachana University:
2 quizzes - 15 marks each
1 mid-semester exam - 30 marks
1 end semester exam - 40 marks
The mid-semester and quizzes are considered like internal assessments in which scoring a minimum of 18 marks are mandatory to be eligible for the end semester exam. Scoring a minimum of 12 marks is mandatory in the end-semester exam. If you fail to obtain the minimum marks, you will have to appear for the exams again.
A minimum attendance of 80% is mandatory otherwise you will not be allowed to appear for the exams. Do not bunk the lectures as they are very informative and you will enjoy every bit of it. However, the environment at the campus is chill and no one will force you to attend the classes."
228,Amity University,Can hostelers at Amity go outside campus anytime?,"My senior from school who used to be a student of Amity University told me that attending 9 to 5 classes all week did get tiring for her. No matter how urgent your work is, you will not be allowed to leave the grounds of the college until and unless you acquire an out-pass. It has to be duly signed by the warden with a valid date. It would invite trouble if you try to outsmart the warden. The girl students are not allowed to leave the campus just like that for security reasons.
For the boys, it’s easier to leave the campus if they share a good rapport with their mentors. Availability of swipe-in and out cards allows the students the premises of the institute at any time but they have to be back by 7-8 PM.

231,Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology - [NIET],What is your review of Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology(NIET)?,"One of my close friends attended NIET and here is his take on the institute.
The main recruiter on campus is TCS. You will be able to apply for the company no matter which branch you belong to. Apart from TCS, MNCs that visit the campus are UHG, Capgemini, etc. for CS/IT students. There will also be a few other companies based on your branch.
Maximum recruiting companies hire students in sales, marketing, business analyst job roles.
There are no placements for the Civil branch. The faculties are not that experienced either.
NIET advertises about their good placement records, but if you go through the placement list you will find that most of the placements at the institute are in sales profile.
The institute claims that the Indian Army and Indian Navy visit the placement drive every year. But in his 4-year duration of the course, my friend didn’t witness anyone getting recruited by them.
The infrastructure of the college is also not that good. WiFi is not that useful, you have to use VPN to open common sites like youtube.
There is no fest, and little to no exposure.
According to my friends, it will be better if you don’t consider NIET as an option, rather go for other alternatives if you have them."

The institute calls parents if they don’t attend your class. 
The hostel curfew timing for girls is strict. You need to be inside the hostel premises at 6 pm during winter and 6:30 pm during summer. 
The video will take you on a tour across the ABES Capus
Overall, your time at ABES EC will be a bittersweet one."

Apart from just an academic point of view, you are better off joining some other college.
In TSEC at the end of 4 years, you do get a B.E degree but you'll be more proficient in event management, marketing, publicity, management, public speaking, and other skills.
The teaching is similar to what you would find in any other college.
The college is anti-ragging. People here are cooperative and friendly.

However, there are some concerns about the college that are mentioned below:
Funding: Velammal Medical College and Velammal Schools need money and are funded by VEC, VIT, and Velammal College in Madurai. 
Charges and Food: VEC charges a breakage fee at the end of the semester, even if nothing has been broken. Additionally, the canteen and mess are overpriced, and there have been reports of bugs and worms in the food.
Faculty: Most of the professors at VEC are lazy and are busy motivating their students to do their Ph.D. work. While some professors may be less passionate about teaching, others may be more engaged with their students and committed to providing quality education.

Lab Assistants: Most of them are rude, and the procedure to use lab equipment is lengthy. While this may be a concern, it's important to remember that lab assistants are responsible for ensuring that lab equipment is used safely and effectively. The procedures in place may be necessary to prevent damage to the equipment or ensure the safety of the students."
239,Velammal Engineering College - [VEC],Which is the best college among these Velammal Engineering College vs Panimalar vs RMK?,"Thiagarajar College of Engineering is a Government college under Anna University. Velammal Engineering College is a private college under the same university. If you have a good rank to join, then you should not have second thoughts about your desired college and opt for a Government/ Government – aided college.

There are several reasons why pursuing your graduation from a government college is beneficial.
Lower fee- Government colleges under Anna University costs less as compared to Private Colleges. This makes it difficult to pay the loans once you land a job which is again a bit difficult given how bad placement opportunities are at a Private University.
Freedom- Unlike Private Colleges which force-feed Engineering into you, Government Colleges promote Self Learning which also gives a bit of freedom to the students. All of your interests like Sports, Extra-Curricular, Co-Curricular, etc will be nurtured in a Government College.
Alumni- The Govt. colleges under Anna are around 60 years old and have a large alumni base. You can easily find a TCE alumina around you. The Private colleges have limited or no Alumni base as they have been recently established.
Placement- Placements at these Govt. institutes great. Many reputed MNCs like Google/Microsoft/Amazon visit the campus regularly. The placement average for Govt. colleges is also higher than private ones. 
So, it is definitely better to choose a Govt. funded or Govt. aided institute than a private institute under Anna University."

240,Oriental University - [OU],"which is best, Amity Gwalior or Oriental Indore?","I have a few friends at Amity University Gwalior, and based on their experience at the institute I will recommend Amity. 
The schedule at Amity is quite hectic, and it always ensured that students make the most of their time on campus, particularly during classes. It implant values such as punctuality, sincerity, and time management, which take years to enshrine in a student's lifestyle. 
It is the ideal location for you if you are serious about your studies.
As you become more familiar with the campus and your specific course, you will notice how the environment and elders begin to shape your overall personality brick by brick, restructuring it into an ultra-professional one that will serve as a home for confidence and increased self-esteem in you. 
Aside from that, the Amity has successfully adapted a global standard of education. Amity University has tasted impressive progress over the last few decades thanks to ambitious learning methods and a broad vision for quality education in India.
Finally, university festivals are a feast for the youth's hearts and minds. These festivals have something for everyone. They encourage students to think outside the box and to break free from the constraints of limited perspectives.
Being said that, Amity does charge a hefty course fee. So, if you are on a budget you can go to Oriental University. Indore is a great city with many internship opportunities. You have to be the one to make the final call."

Some of them include GQs, EQs, and others. Mainly, the professors go around to encourage you in scoring particularly well in your semesters.
There is another factor you need to understand. If you are planning to go for acquiring a good knowledge base, then you will also have access to certain topics such as Stack Overflow, Instructables, Hackster, arXiv.org, Ieee Xplore, and several others.
You might not receive the knowledge base in either of the institutes, but you can still have a slight edge at Vidyalankar Institute of Technology if you go for a good GPA.
Besides, the faculty is supportive and more importantly, encouraging. The labs are well maintained and particularly well equipped as well."

The student crowd is diverse, you will meet people from all over the country. 
Graphic Era placements are good. According to the recent placement drive, The average CTC offered to the students is INR 5.38 LPA. Adobe, Zscaler, Teradata, etc. are some of the significant recruiters in the placement drive."
248,University of Engineering and Management - [UEM],Which is better between Techno India University and UEM Kolkata?,"One of my cousins studied at UEM. He said that there is no such guarantee of placement. If you aspire to be placed, you will need to develop proper skills, have proper training, and then be assured of placement. 
The points below are some of the key factors essential for placement, and the placement status of UEM Kolkata.
You should have a lot of potential and choosing the right institute will provide training and opportunities. 
Attaining skills are most important.
UEM is a new institute and is not as good as IEM Kolkata. 
For management courses, BIBS Kolkata is offering a good enough curriculum and placement. But, there is no guarantee of placement. 
According to the advertisements of IEM, they have provided chances of placement to every student in at least one company. But, being in the ads, there are chances that it is not the correct statistics.

248,University of Engineering and Management - [UEM],How is the campus placement of UEM Kolkata? What is the average salary package?,"My brother studied in IEM Kolkata and firstly, it is a reputed college in West Bengal, even more than Jadavpur and IIEST Shibpur. The placement rate at IEM is about 80%-90%. On the other hand, UEM is a regular engineering college with only a few defining features. Its fame is because of the fact that it was established by the IEM trust.
However, if you compare UEM with IEM then, IEM wins on the faculty quality and placement scenario. At IEM, the teachers are friendly and enthusiastic.
IEM also has a limited number of seats that are filled based on the rank in WBJEE. It does not have a management quota.
UEM was established recently, so it is a relatively new private university and is the third of the three engineering institutions founded by the IEM-UEM Group.
UEM is a much more disciplined institution, quiet more than IEM.
If you're keen on choosing between these two, I'd suggest you consider the student intake because if the number is lesser then it's better. For this, you can ask alumni or someone currently studying there. Some students also have a negative view of IEM. The IT department is not as good because my brother's friend is there and claims that the professors do not know even the basics of the program. 
So, be very refined in your research before choosing."
248,University of Engineering and Management - [UEM],What is the difference between IEM and UEM in Kolkata?,"According to the experience of one of my friends at UEM Kolkata, the campus is one of the favorite places. When it comes to the environment inside the campus that is one of the main key factors to produce quality students.
The classes are conducted regularly with utmost sincerity and if they are suspended due to some reasons extra classes are conducted on Saturdays to fulfill the loss. Since there is a biometric system for attendance, no student can bunk the classes.
CCTV cameras are installed in every classroom that monitors the students for the entire day due to which the campus is a completely ragging-free area.
There is an anti-ragging cell and if anyone is caught ragging others he/she gets rusticated immediately. There is a privilege of choosing your faculty as every student is given a faculty feedback form.
80% attendance is mandatory for all otherwise you will not be allowed to give examinations.
It is a safe place for girls, and drinking or smoking is completely prohibited in the campus area.
There is a culture of maintaining and following complete discipline on the campus. No one is allowed to enter the college premises after 9 AM sharp.
Lastly, we can say that UEM, Kolkata is a place that not only provides quality education but at the same time grooms the overall personality of a child that helps him/her in the future."
248,University of Engineering and Management - [UEM],"Should I go for CSE in Techno India College of Technology, Rajarhat, or UEM Kolkata?","My elder brother is an alumnus of UEM Kolkata. The timings are not exactly flexible.
The first shift takes place from 9:20 AM to 4:00 PM. On any two days of the week, the class schedule will be from 9:15 AM to 5:45 PM.
Two recesses are also included in the schedule.
The morning assembly is held from 9:00 AM to 9:20 AM.
The second shift is from 12:15 PM to 5:45 PM.
You can also consult for choosing one shift in case you are not comfortable with the other shift. A lot of students managed to get their shifts changed so take it with a grain of salt.
The second shift is the one where my brother was because there would be no stress of being late for class, less tension for submission of assignments. The only thing that will “tire” you will be the excursions.
The institute offers commendable infrastructural facilities and quality education to the students which is why so many students choose this college for pursuing engineering and management."
248,University of Engineering and Management - [UEM],"If I join UEM Kolkata, will I get guaranteed placement?","I have a few friends who are alumni of UEM, Rajarhat and they don’t recommend the institute.
UEM mostly gives admission through management quota. The college takes admission with WBJEE scores up to 80,000. 
Most of the students get placement in IT companies as it is set up by the IEM group. The average CTC of the college is around 4 LPA
But IEM has its own college in Kolkata which is far more reputed than UEM. UEM Jaipur campus is also great for engineering. UEM Kolkata does have the potential to become as good as the Jaipur campus with time. But as of now, it is not that great."

253,Federal Institute of Science and Technology - [FISAT],Is FISAT better than Amal Jyothi?,"The E&I department at FISAT is an exceptional one. I have a friend who attended the institute and here’s what he had to say about it. If you have a general idea about instrumentation and are determined regarding it in the future then FISAT would be the best fit for you.
At FISAT, you would come across the best of lab facilities which are not available in many institutes, and the finest faculty base.
This institute provides an environment for the growth and development of personality. You would be able to create memories to cherish forever in this college. Enjoying your college life would not be troublesome as there are present many spots for you to hang out with your friends around the campus.
Unlike other colleges, FISAT is quite on the lenient side. The authorities are not that strict about uniforms and wearing ID cards.
Placement opportunities are decent given you do not have any backlogs. It wouldn’t be wise to expect offer packages from core companies. Unless you tend to be exceptionally skillful and hardworking in your field or have contacts with higher-ups and influential people, landing a good placement in core companies would be of great difficulty.
Overall FISAT will give you a great college life and good facilities."
253,Federal Institute of Science and Technology - [FISAT],"Which is better for CSE - Rajagiri, SCMS, Mar Baselios, or FISAT?","It entirely depends on the branch that you are choosing. If you go for CSE then all the colleges SCT, RAJAGIRI, FISAT, SCMS have good placements opportunities. But in the case of other branches, Kerala colleges have a low level of placement except for NITs and IITs.
Good placements are available only for software firms and not for your core jobs. All the colleges above are good and will help you to attain the skills required for different jobs.
And everything depends on you how much effort you will give to your course so that you can obtain experience as well as knowledge so that you can get a good job apart from your college placements"

262,Babu Banarasi Das University - [BBDU],"What is your review of Babu Banarasi Das University, Lucknow?","As far as these two colleges are concerned, both are equally good in their respective locations. Lucknow is known as the capital city which will come with its own set of benefits. But, if you want to directly compare, my vote would go for PSIT Kanpur as it is especially good for computer science engineering.
Moreover, PSIT is also a private college. This will have its benefits including better placements for CS and other branches as well as compared to other institutes that are not based on NCRs. PSIT has also become one of the fastest-growing institutes in North India.
PSIT is also known for its discipline, faculty, and facilities which, are the best here as compared to BBD. However, BBD is less strict than PSIT so you can expect a little more personal growth at this college than the other one.
Finally, it all boils down to what you like. You can also choose the college which is nearer to you."
262,Babu Banarasi Das University - [BBDU],"What is the placement record of BBD University, Lucknow?","If you want to enjoy college life along with your studies, then this is the right place for you. There are not many rules and regulations. One of the closest friends is a student of Babu Banarsi Das University, so I am quite aware of the reality.
Infrastructure:
The infrastructure of the college is great with outlets like Nescafe and CCD.
There are 2 canteens for the students to relax and sit comfortably. You will love the campus. 
Other facilities include a cricket stadium, gym, Auditorium, Radio station, ATM, Temple, and Hostels.
Academic Life
There are no fixed timings, however, you must try and report sharp at 9 AM.
The uniform for students is Blue jeans and a white shirt.
You can attend only 1 or 2 lectures in a day but 75% attendance is mandatory for all. Skipping class can affect your marks in internals, however, you can cover them in externals examination.
Placements:
In comparison with other colleges in Lucknow, placements are fine for BBD. 
You must not expect high or top MNCs packages. It all depends on your personality and hard work, so it's up to you how to crack the job offer.
Faculty: They are supportive and will provide you every kind of help you need and will also guide you well regarding your career opportunities.
Let’s now discuss a few Cons about the college:
Rural Background: You may find it difficult to adapt here if you are from metropolitan cities, as the majority of the population comes from rural backgrounds. No entrance tests are conducted here which means everybody is readily admitted.
No Discipline: You can just sit for your end-semester exams even if you haven’t attended classes the whole semester. You will not be allowed to give your internals for low attendance, but you can clear the end semester.
You can choose this college if you have no options left, or you just want a graduation degree."
262,Babu Banarasi Das University - [BBDU],"Which university is better, BBD or Ramswaroop?","BBDU is a fraud engineering college because it does not meet the requirements required for the industry. This implies that students who graduated from this college are not skilled engineers.
The question is irrelevant since there are no placements in the colleges. All degree holders are transferred as clerks in the service-based businesses owned by the owners of the college.
It is also true that the pool-campus are only organized to deceive the degree holders. All 4-tier colleges and the companies involved in the recruitment share the same mindset of individuals.
Placement usually occurs when an engineering company requires trained engineers and searches at different colleges for such individuals. These companies offer an initial salary of 60,000 rupees per month as this is the usual salary of every engineer in the world.
Some facts regarding BBD University for B.Tech, if you still want to apply to this university are:
Total course fee
5 lakhs
Total seats available
120 seats available
NIRF ranking
495th rank
Average salary package
4 lakhs
Most of the degree holders are placed as clerks in the services based companies owned by the college owners. The average salary package is up to only 2 to 3 lakh per year."
263,JIS College of Engineering - [JISCE],How good is JIS College of Engineering?,"My brother enrolled in the BTech program at JIS College of Engineering after going through a lot of brainstorming as a school graduate. Yes, it is a private engineering college but it has been ranked as one of the 'Best Private Engineering Colleges in Kolkata' and is amongst the 'Top 100 Colleges in India' by the Times of India i3RC Survey on Engineering Colleges of India. 
You may want to know at the following points:
Location- JIS Engineering College has a 17.5 acres campus in Kalyani, West Bengal. The space is vast, green, and refreshing to behold.
Courses Available- JISCE offers a wide variety of programs in engineering and technology like the following- B.Tech in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Information Technology, Electronics, and Communication Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Apart from these, it also runs degrees in BCA, BBA & MBA.
Tuition Fees- If you're worried that being a private college they'll charge high fees- then you Don't worry because the fees are nominal: for instance, it is INR 3-4 LPA for a BE/BTech program.
Infrastructure and Hostel Availability- JIS has one of the best infrastructures because of its Flip Learning facility, seven smart classrooms, labs, library, canteen, and a recording studio with a 24x7 recording facility for both students and faculty members to record digital audio-visual content. There are two separate hostels for boys and girls.
For internships and placements, each department has its own internship provision and if you're a brilliant student, you might even get to work with the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok. The placement rate is also a good 78-80% with an average salary of around 2-3 LPA and the highest being INR 6-10 LPA; BME and CSE are the best departments in terms of placements. 
However, if you're not comfortable with strictness then rethink your decision to enroll because JIS has its own dress code. Also, the 75% compulsory attendance rule is not relaxed at any cost. Although this strictness has one good point too, as JIS is a fully ragging-free campus, hence students can join without any stress on that matter."
263,JIS College of Engineering - [JISCE],Can i take direct admission in this college for Bca course? And what's the hostel fee?,"JIS College of Engineering (JISCE) is the 2nd branch of the JIS group of institutions.

The university looks lucrative, but it is worse. Your experience will turn out to be unpleasant. The following are the troubles faced by the students of Rayat Bahra University.
It is a money-minded institute. The institute collects monetary contributions for every upcoming event. 
Even for the Wi-Fi, you need to pay separately, but you cannot access the facility. 
The faculty members lack teaching skills. They have limited knowledge. Sometimes it can be felt that the students are more intelligent than the teachers. 
In addition to these, even the placements are not guaranteed by the university.
These reasons justify why the institute has no rank in any of the authentic-official rankings."
264,Rayat Bahra University,"Which university is better for law, Chandigarh University or Rayat Bahra University?","There are several reasons why you should not take admission to Rayat Bahra University, Mohali.
One of them is its placement. The jobs offered are in the BPO sector or telephonic. Surprisingly, they lack any core placement. The students of the university are not highly satisfied with the placement records they commonly have to go through.
The packages usually ranged from 2 LPA to 3 LPA. Mainly, the university lacks the crucial commodities required for law students. Amenities such as courtrooms or trial rooms are commonly not seen at Rayat Bahra University, Mohali, making it one of the biggest downsides.
Other than that, there is allegedly no professionalism. The department of law usually does not conduct expert sessions, webinars, seminars, or workshops for students.
It is alleged that the faculties are usually not paid their salaries often for about a period of 6 months.
The syllabus or the curriculum commonly followed by the university is not up to the Industrial Standards and students generally get affected due to most of it.

279,Symbiosis Institute of Technology - [SIT],Should I join Symbiosis Institute of Technology Pune for CS even if I get MIT Pune and VIT Pune?,"There are several parameters to compare the two colleges. Some of these are-
Brand- Symbiosis is a brand in India. Any college under Symbiosis International University automatically gets the tag of a good college. VIT Pune is also a well known brand which was established much before SIT. VIT Pune was established in 1983 while SIT came into existence in 2008.
Placements- VIT Pune has a better placement scenario. As far as SIT is concerned, CS/IT and ENTC have an average placement record. On the other hand, Mechanical and Civil have a low placement rate. But the fact is that Mechanical is facing placement shortage at present.
Crowd- The SIT campus has a diverse crowd. It caters to students from all over India, and NRIs. VIT is mainly preferred by students of Maharashtra and its neighboring states.
Infrastructure- Both the colleges have good classrooms and laboratories.
Faculty- I don’t know much about VIT, but the faculty of SIT is highly qualified.
Campus- The SIT campus is located far from the city, but it is huge and has a scenic view. The campus is beautiful and has all the sports facilities.
Both the colleges are equally good. You may choose any of them on the basis of their location, crowd and other factors."

The campus is lovely, and in terms of life experience.
There's no better college to associate with such a diverse group of people, including international exchange students as well.
But, if you're concerned about your academics, then it’s a bitter truth for you. Most of the colleges in India only provide you with a syllabus and the rest is all self-study. Symbiosis is no exception.
Though, if it's any consolation, the CSE placement scene is pretty decent in Symbiosis. Getting an internship is considerably easy here.

Based on the interaction I had with her, here are some of the insights she shared with me that might be helpful:
In SNIST, all the faculty members are highly qualified and well experienced in their particular field. They are cooperative and helpful.
For core knowledge and preparing for government jobs, GATE, etc. SNIST might not be a good choice.
GRIET, unlike SNIST, has a mix of good and bad faculty members. It also has a high concentration on robotics and microcontroller programming.

288,GITAM,"Which is better: SRM, HINDUSTAN, SASTRA, GITAM university?","I am a student at SRM, so I will tell you particularly about my university.
SRM is a highly-graded university with experienced faculty, rich academics, and a good campus life. My experience of SRM has been quite pleasant up till now. You’ll learn a lot at this place, and develop excellent communication skills. You’ll be given good projects. 
This university has a highly diverse population and a multidisciplinary approach to studies. It has a good reputation and a decent placement record. IT and CSE students get on-campus placements for sure. However, for Aerospace, only 1 or 2 companies visit the campus with job offers. Companies like Byjus and Jaro Education offer around 13 LPA and are open to all engineering branches. 
I would personally recommend SRM for your studies as it offers an all-around development with decent placements."

The present status of the design department is on the verge of collapsing in both of the institutions. They almost got shut down last year. The number of students was very less and the existing students shifted elsewhere.
Rather than going to Avantika University or G.D.Goenka, you can go to other colleges such as the World University of Design and MIT Pune. These are the institutes you should be joining if you are looking forward to pursuing Designing. Both are mainstream design universities and way better than what you are thinking of."

295,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT],"Which college is better, BIT Patna or NIT Patna?","Among the institutes, Marwadi University is an institute with several advantages and quite a few notable disadvantages in different aspects.
The points below give a brief overview of Marwadi University, stating some of the key highlights.
Over the years, Marwadi University has developed a decent infrastructure in terms of technology, buildings, facilities, classrooms, etc.
Considering the faculties of Marwadi University, there is a mix of qualified young as well as experienced faculties in all departments of the institute.
The overall academic processes of the university have improved a lot with time. It also provides a student-friendly environment inside the campus.
The main disadvantage of the university, which has a heavy impact on the overall growth and other positive aspects, is its poor quality of students. The institute takes in almost 99.5% of students from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat.
For proper financial funding and achieving its desired figure of student count, the institute gives admission to several students with poor or below-average academic records. This is the main reason for ruining the classroom atmosphere at Marwadi University.
Due to the poor quality of students, some teachers start to teach in the local Gujarati Kathiyawadi language, which the outsiders can’t understand. This is a matter of utter frustration for others.
There is no healthy competition among students in academics. Most of them are just interested in passing the exams only.
There are several students in the institute who come from wealthy backgrounds. They are usually not at all interested in placement, and so ruin the overall atmosphere for other students to concentrate.
It is always advised that you should go to an institute that has a healthy, competitive environment, with an interest in gaining knowledge and make a proper career in the industry."

306,Dr. C.V. Raman University - [CVRU],Can anybody give the correct Dr. CV Raman University review?,"Dr. C.V. Raman University is a newly established institute, which offers average-level infrastructure, opportunities, and placement. There are several reviews about the university being a fraud institute, which is not at all true. The points below give a brief overview of the institute.
It offers decent placement, considering its recent establishment. It is obvious that students in the institute should not expect companies like Microsoft and Google o conduct recruitment drives in it.
It is one of the finest private colleges in Chandigarh and provides good academic as well as port facilities inside its campus. The scenario of job opportunities provided by the institute is getting better with time.
The institute is a good place for students who are actually interested to study a specific engineering course, and go to research fields in the future.
The main backlash that the institute faces is the truth of its establishment, due to several fake negative reviews over the internet. For this case, students can visit the UGC website to verify the identity of the university.
It is a decent choice for an engineering degree and is a legit institute. Being a newer institute, it is still in the phase of development and growth."
306,Dr. C.V. Raman University - [CVRU],Is a Dr. CV Raman University degree valid in India and foreign countries?,"Dr. CV Raman University’s degree is valid and recognized in India as well as in most foreign countries. CV Raman University fake reviews have been circulating, due to which many people have been doubtful about its authenticity. Here's why:
UGC Recognition: The fact that the university is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) under Section 2(f) is a significant indicator of its legitimacy. UGC recognition is crucial for the validity of degrees in India.
Multiple Accreditation: Dr. CV Raman University holds recognition from several other reputable regulatory bodies like AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education), BCI (Bar Council of India), AIU (Association of Indian Universities), NCTE (National Council for Teacher Education), UNSG (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals), and MPPC (Madhya Pradesh Private University Regulatory Commission). These recognitions reinforce the credibility of the degrees it offers.
 Awards and Recognition: The university's receipt of various awards and recognition over the years is a testament to its commitment to quality education and standards.
Alumni Success: The fact that alumni of the institute are working in various MNCs (Multinational Corporations) in both India and abroad further validates the quality and recognition of its degrees.
In conclusion, with the recognition and accreditation it holds, a degree from Dr. CV Raman University is indeed valid and reputable in both India and many foreign countries."
307,Jigyasa University (Formerly Himgiri Zee University),Is Himgiri Zee University that good and has UGC permission?,"No, Himgiri Zee University is not a good choice, considering several factors which are quite serious regarding the career of its students in the future. There are several reviews of the institute from its students and aspirants, considering it to be a fraud institute too.
The points below give a brief outlook that can be deduced from some of the legit reviews of the institute.
The Animation and Visual Effects course is taught across different states in India through franchise institutes of Himgiri Zee University. Those institutes providing the course are affiliated with HZU and are not direct branches.
If you are thinking of opting for HZU should step back from this thought for the betterment of your career. The certificate provided by HZU has no guarantee of proper recognition in the industry in the future.
Alumni of HZU have not received their convocation certificate long after their completion of graduation too. Due to this issue, they are unable to go for further studies or apply for jobs.
Students who are very much interested in the courses provided by HZU should do all kinds of research before enrolling in a course at the institute. This decision drives the future and career of students. Moreover, one wrong decision will result in a waste of 3-4 prime years of life.
Therefore, students are advised not to opt for any course from Himgiri Zee University, as it may prove to be useless and a waste of time and career."
307,Jigyasa University (Formerly Himgiri Zee University),I want to do BSC (Agriculture) from Himgiri Zee University Dehradun. Is it a better choice to do it from there?,"Himgiri Zee University Dehradun is a good choice only if you are planning to pursue any course in the field of agriculture from this university. Apart from agriculture, Himgiri Zee University is not well known for any other specialized courses. 
According to the majority of reviews provided by former students, the university doesn’t provide the facilities promised at the time of admission. The university is definitely not the right choice for pursuing any specialized course.
Former students complain about the lack of coordination from the management of the university.
The university does not offer good placements. Even the students of Mass-communication are placed in posts like content-writer or back-end jobs.
Some of the courses at the university even have 2-3 students in total. A friend of mine did his MBA from this university and had a total of 4 classmates.
However, the Agriculture department is good and offers decent academics.

332,Amity University,"Which college, St. Xaviers Ranchi or Amity Ranchi, would be more preferable for a B.B.A. programme?","Don’t choose Amity University for a master's degree. Amity has good campuses and infrastructure. For bachelor's, it is a decent option. But for MCA, you should consider reputed colleges under state universities or central universities. JNU, NIT, and IIT are some good options for MCA. If you need, you can take a gap year and prepare again."
333,Chandigarh Group of Colleges - [CGC] Jhanjeri,Which campus of CGC is better and why? Landran or Jhanjeri?,"Both the campus has their own merits and demerits. Go through the following points to find out.
Hostels: Jhanjheri campus has hostel rooms more spacious and has better bedding accessories than Landran. Overall Jhanjheri hostels have better bathrooms, gym, common room, food, mess facilities than Landran.
Festivals: Festivals are better at Jhanjheri and many celebs come to the campus to perform.
Faculty: As Jhanjheri is the new campus, most of the good faculties go to Jhanjheri.
Placements: Placement companies come to Landran but that’s not an issue as it is a joint placement drive and Jhanjheri students participate in it as well.
Transportation: Jhajhri campus is 7km away from Landran, and you won’t get a bus to Chandigarh or any nearby cities for the campus. You have to take an auto from Jhanjheri to Landran or Kharar.
Small Campus: The Jhanjheri campus is smaller than Landran but it offers better facilities.
Less Crowded: Jhanjheri campus is less crowded. It can be a good thing or a bad thing based on how you perceive it.
These are the basic difference between the two campuses. Now, it’s up to you to choose which is better for you."
333,Chandigarh Group of Colleges - [CGC] Jhanjeri,What is your review of CGC Jhanjeri?,"My cousin studies at CGC Jhanjeri and it's a nice and average place to be. Following are some issues though, which may be burdensome:
If you wish to go out during college hours then you will need to get an application signed by the CC and the HOD. The process itself will take up a lot of time.
Girls can stay out up to 7 pm in summers and 6 pm in winters and you can step out to roam in the campus by 4:30 and you will have to return in two hours to avoid sending a call home.
You should have at least a 75% attendance like most colleges, but it will be evaluated every 15 days. You will have to attend 75% of 15 days to avoid detention during the Monthly Sessional Tests of MSTs.
The campus is verdant and hygienic and it has a playground, but it is surrounded by grasslands on all sides up to 5 Kms. It has all the basic amenities like stationery shops, sports ground, pool, games room, etc.
Even transportation is an issue and autos and buses are the only way but quite time-consuming.
Hostel, mess food, cleanliness, room Sharing are not any issues at all. You will not have to worry about ragging too. You can go to Chandigarh for shopping after getting your passbook filled and signed by the Warden.
However, you cannot bunk because the campus is small, you can get discovered very easily and may face some good punishment. As for placements, it all depends upon research-based hard work and skills. Major companies do visit for recruitment."
333,Chandigarh Group of Colleges - [CGC] Jhanjeri,"Is there any Difference in faculty, placements, Facilities between CGC Landran & CGC Jhanjeri?

The placements for both campuses take place at the same time. The students sit together for their placements.
I have a few friends at both institutes and most of them recommend Chandigarh Engineering college Landran campus over Jhanjeri campus because this campus is the oldest, the environment is good, and it is located near to Mohali.
CGC Landran is better in terms of infrastructure and faculty members as well. The CSC department of this college is good. According to the recent placement highlights the average and highest CTC offered at the institutes is 7 LPA and 35 LPA."

335,XIM University,How good is XIMB for rural management?,"Rural management at XIMB is a decent option for students, which is even considered at par with the Indian Institute of Rural Management, Anand. There are several notions in the minds of people, which creates doubt about whether to choose Rural management or not. The points below give a clear picture of the course, addressing the benefits and the genuine outcomes of the degree.
It consists of all the subjects taught in BM and HRM, along with some extra subjects dealing with rural management.
You can go through the previous year's CAT cut-offs to decide which institute or stream is better. The cut-off for XIMB-RM is lower than HRM and BM, which makes you to remove it from your preference, which is a wrong notion. More than half of the entire class of rural management have excellent scores in CAT or XAT. Mostly, there are students with CAT cut-offs around 75-90 in RM. 
The rural management course at XIMB is quite good and ranked close to IRMA. It is ranked second in the country after IIM Ahmedabad and 19th worldwide. 
The majority of people believe that Rural Management students are hired only by development agencies and NGOs, which is another wrong notion. Several Consulting, IT companies, BFSI, and FMCG come to recruits RM students in placement.
People even think that Rural Managers have to work in interior parts of India. But the fact is that most RMs work in tier-1 or tier-2 cities, and visit rural interiors as a part of their work for monitoring their company works.
Engineering back-out from doing MBA at rural management, thinking that their work experience would be of no value for the degree. But, just like any other streams, work experience gets extra emphasis in rural management too.
The placements in RM are of average quality at present but are at rapid growth. Having an average package is still satisfactory, which will lead to a handsome package within two years. There are students from RM having excellent salary packages, which are the result of their hard work and maximum course extraction.
Students from IT companies have a good scope in RM as most IT or consulting companies working in rural regions have projects from government and micro-finance companies, and so are in great demand.
These are some of the key highlights and clarifications to most wrong notions about Rural Management from XIMB, which is indeed a good option having ample opportunities and great scope in the future."
335,XIM University,How good is HRM of XIMB and what are the profiles usually offered to the students?,"While choosing a college, you should look at all the factors, from subject preference to infrastructure. Going through the pros and cons will let you decide whether to choose Xavier University Bhubaneswar for BTech in Computer Science Engineering:-
Pros
Infrastructure: The infrastructure of Xavier University Bhubaneswar is excellent. They provide all the necessary facilities. The university has PG and UG hostels, Chapel, Multi-dimensional ground. The campus is wifi enabled. Computer labs are sophisticated and the library is well equipped.
Faculty: The professors are all PhD holders from various IITs and universities abroad. All the faculty members are highly qualified and encourage active participation by the students.
Course structure: The syllabus is different from other colleges. Xavier University has a credit system that is followed by the university. Students get to choose their subjects.
Exposure: Seminars are organized by the college. Various guest teachers and lecturers from foreign universities participate and share valuable knowledge.
Cons
Placements: The placement provided by the college is decent and not as good as promoted. The university is new therefore there is less data to show the placement percentages and average of each year to know the current position of the college in terms of placements.
Slow Management: The staff and the management of the college is slow. Work gets delayed most of the time.
Therefore, based on these factors you can choose to study in Xavier University Bhubaneswar for pursuing BTech in CSE."
335,XIM University,How is Xavier University Bhubaneswar for btech CSE?,"RM and SM are different schools now and are no longer considered XIMB. XSRM and XSoS are now Xavier School of Rural Management and Xavier School of Sustainable Management respectively. 
The RM and SM programs come under Xavier University, Bhuvaneshwar. This means that post the convocation, your degree would read “XUB” and not “XIMB”. But you would be happy to know that the faculty is the same and placements are deserving. 
You would be exposed to diverse sectors regardless of what course you are pursuing. 
If RM and SM are the only specializations for you, it’s then up to you to choose whatever future you would like. Agricultural finance and GIS tagging are some sectors that are in trend these days in the line of either specialization. 
Both the courses are equally good and have their own importance. So, it’s all your decision, which field you want to pursue your career in."

The infrastructure of FISAT is good as it has been equipped with all the essentials things for an engineering aspirant.
FISAT has a digital library, canteen facility, well-equipped gym, all kinds of sports like Volleyball, basketball, cricket nets and grounds same ground for the football too, table tennis and cultural activities. 
Placement: (Winning Institution - FISAT)
FISAT offers decent on-campus internships by TCS.
The placements are comparatively lower than FISAT as FISAT has good connectivity to Kerala and it has the largest intake, so FISAT has an advantage over AMAL JYOTHI.

The syllabus and especially the question paper is not the traditional type but rather stimulates you to think. 
They have a much advanced, updated curriculum and it is possible because they don’t come under any university and hence have the liberty to mold according to the latest industry standards.
Placement: (Winning Institution - Amrita University)
It is not easier to get placed from Amrita because you study in Amrita does not mean you will get high placements because the crowd in Amrita is more competitive. 
All those who missed out on JEE come to Amrita. Top companies like Microsoft, Facebook, CISCO recruit only from Amrita out of those mentioned.
Campus Life: (Winning Institution - Amrita University)
The clubs in Amrita are almost international, as it conducts the prestigious ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). Which itself is a benchmark to look for, acknowledging non-premier institutes like IITs, NITs, and BITs. 
The clubs in Amrita are more diverse and active. It's tech-fest ANOKHA is also much better. 
If you don’t have a blend with a very diverse crowd go for Amrita. Going by all the factors mentioned above, it is safe to say that Amrita University is a better alternative."

Overall, there isn’t much difference between the two colleges. If you are planning to pursue your post-graduate studies, the college will probably not matter but your studies definitely will. You should also take into account the distance you might have to travel every day which could play a major role.
My suggestion to you would be to write down the pros and cons of both the colleges and see which matters more. Is it the college name or the college stream?"
345,Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology - [BPIT],"Which is better, CSE at BPIT or ECE at MAIT, MSIT, or BVP?","The point of concern here is your branch preference.
For CSE it completely depends on your skill. If you are skilled enough, you are good to go off-campus. There are a lot of opportunities. You do not have to bother about on-campus placements.
For ECE campus matters. There are a few core companies in ECE and they visit IITs only. Chances are low getting in core with off-campus too. So, ECE students either do coding or go for M-Tech or join small core companies offering low packages. Once you are good with Softwares/ Basics you are as good as a CSE graduate.
However, MAIT is more reputed than the remaining colleges. Here is a brief highlight of the recent placement statistics for MAIT.

346,Bhilai Institute of Technology - [BIT],Which is better for CSE: BIT Durg or NIT Raipur?,"Both Manipal Institute of Technology and Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg are excellent engineering colleges with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Here is why you should consider joining BIT Durga instead of MIT Manipal.
Fees: MIT Manipal BTech fees are INR 18.62 Lakhs while BTech first-year fees of Bhilai Institute of Technology are just INR 81,862.
Location : BIT is situated in a very small city Durg. However, there aren't any connectivity issues as the railway station is quite near. You only need a bike to roam the entire city
Education : Very few qualified professors can be found here as the institute is very old.
Placements: One of my friends told me about the placement scenario at BIT Durga. The highest CTC stood at INR 20 LPA while the average CTC stood at INR 4.5 LPA. 
The only major flaw the institute has is that despite being a 28-year-old institute it's affiliated to a 7-year-old university which affects the quality of education. 
In all, if you dont want to spend much then BIT Durga is the right option for you."

Most core companies do not hire B.Tech students as they get their work done by BSc.
Graduates at a very low pay scale, public sectors are good to look for a job.
If you want to go into the research and development field, then you need to go for JRF interviews, once you get selected you will do various projects under a well-qualified scientist.
Also, 2 years of JRF and SRF can get you a Ph.D. degree.
You can join various research centers like ICAR, CSIR, NIO, and many others.
You can even give GATE, or GRE and do masters first, then apply for a job.
This will make you more capable and many other options will be open for you after pursuing a master's degree.
Thus concluding we can say that though there are options for you to enter the research and development field, joining research centers, applying for a job, or searching for a job. But pursuing a master's degree would be a much better option as it will provide you ample opportunities to opt for."

357,Maharashtra Institute of Technology - [MIT],What is your review of Maharashtra Institute of Technology?,"Maharashtra Institute of Technology is a private university affiliated with the University of Pune.
Placements are average. The majority of people are placed in companies such as Infosys and Accenture. Companies such as Delloite and Microsoft come to campus, but they only hire a small number of students and offer them competitive salaries.
Very good opportunities for higher education abroad. When it comes to higher education, is affiliated with Unipune has its advantages. Furthermore, the college has a brand value associated with it.
You must be completely dedicated to your hobby or interest in order to pursue it. The cultural team is fantastic for people who are willing to work day and night. The same is true for other activities such as Supra and SAE Baja. The MIT Pune Kothrud campus has a reputation for consistently outstanding performance in national and international Robocon competitions.
The crowd is diverse. Although only 15% of the seats are allocated to students from outside Maharashtra, there are students from all over the country with diverse interests and hobbies.
You can't complain about the infrastructure. Enough for your requirements."
357,Maharashtra Institute of Technology - [MIT],Which is better Bharati Vidyapeeth Pune or Maharashtra Institute of Technology Pune?,"My cousin studies at MIT Pune. It has a massive campus, almost like a small town with more than 30 institutes in Pune. You can reach here from any corner of the city. The crowd here is diverse and multi-talented. 
MIT Pune also has a lot to offer, if you're interested in extracurricular activities. There are various clubs related to music, dance, art, social service, politics etc. There are technical clubs too such as Robocon, Team Baja, Team Supra, etc.
Academically also it's excellent and is one of the top private engineering colleges in Maharashtra. 
The placement scene at MIT is good with a placement rate of 89% for undergraduates and 82% for postgraduates. More than 200 companies visit the campus each year. 
Although, you'll have to make sure that you score at least 60% throughout the academic program.
Even though the crowd is a plus point, but do not forget that the college is in Maharashtra, so most of the students present at MIT are Maharashtrians. However, because of the popularity of the institute, it attracts students from almost all states of India. You can make really good friends there."
357,Maharashtra Institute of Technology - [MIT],"How is the placement for the MCA at MIT (Maharashtra Institute of Technology) in Pune, specifically MITSOM?","One of my friends pursued Bio-Engineering from Maharashtra Institute of Technology.

You will need to depend on yourself for building different skills through short-term courses, internships, or working on different projects.
But in general, MAIT is a reputed college where you can pursue EEE and there is no attendance issue in the college. It also has a good reputation among the IPU colleges. The average CTC offered at the institute is around 3 LPA.
I have few friends at MAIT and based on the reviews I got from them I will suggest you go for their EEE course. But don’t entirely demand the institute for opportunities."

The points below give a brief overview of both the institutes that will support the choice with a lot of valid reasons.
IIIT Kota is an institute of national importance, whereas PICT Pune is a private engineering college in Maharashtra that most people are not aware of.
IIIT Kota has a larger perception of the development of its students. It even offers foreign internship opportunities and has tie-ups with several industries.
IIIT Kota has a very good coding culture and offers excellent placements in top-tier companies across the world. There is no management quota for admission in IIIT Kota.
Coming to PICT Pune, the institute has no ranking and recognition. It is highly attendance-centric and has no hostel for boarding. Even the campus of PICT Pune is just 5 acres in area, with no facilities for activities other than studies on campus.
PICT Pune has no valid tie-ups with companies and does not allow students to go for internships due to attendance issues. There are no modern facilities on the campus.
The syllabus followed by PICT is very old and primitive. It even allows management quota.
Considering the average placement records of the two institutes, CSE at IIIT Kota offers around 10 LPA CTC. For PICT Pune, the average CTC offered is around 7 LPA.
It is obvious that IIIT Kota is a clear winner among the two. But, there are fake reviews from consultants over the internet supporting these institutes, which students should avoid looking after."

377,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,"Which college is better, VIT or Amrita? Why?","I have a friend who attended Amrita University and here’s what he had to say about life at the campus.
Academic Life:
The course curriculum is great and the standards can be even compared to IIT.
The faculty are knowledgeable and will help you with everything. However, self-study, your efforts, and participation in events and competitions, etc. will teach you so much more.
The labs are great and have all the necessary equipment. They also allow you to use the labs after academic hours with due permission.
The library is huge and they also have many online subscriptions.

On weekends, students usually go out to the city to catch a movie or some even go home. Life is good at the campus, you will be busy with many activities."

383,SRM University Delhi NCR,"Which is better, SRM or Manipal University?","There are quite a few stories regarding violence by the local students in SRM University Haryana. Many of these students harass others from other regions and bully them. They will take advantage of you being away from home. They are known to bang doors and walls but they do not stop if you ask them to and it is definitely an unpleasant experience.
There have also been cases of public indecency and the warden or hostel in charge will only make them write an apology letter. As of now, they have been silenced due to incessant complaining but the harassment still continues sometimes.
If you are not from North India, then do not think of coming to SRM University. The batch of 2018-19 was not good at all. Most of the students were ill-minded and perhaps from the goonish areas of Haryana.
If you bring your parents for a visit, most of them will have positive responses as they do not want to be silenced after complaints but this is the current scenario here. My advice to you would be to think twice before you decide to take a seat here."
384,SRM University Sikkim,"Academically speaking, what are the advantages and disadvantages of studying in SRM University, Sikkim?","The students at SRM University Sikkim are not satisfied by the quality of education over there.

Many famous personalities visit the SRM University Sikkim campus from time to time. Academically speaking, SRM University Sikkim is not a good choice. However, in terms of exposure, fun, and college life, the university offers a memorable experience.

385,The Northcap University - [NCU],"Which one is better for a B.tech in CSE, MAIT(IPU) or NorthCAP University?","Talking about B.Tech CSE, Sharda University can be considered a better choice than Northcap. It is a very well reputed institution in terms of opportunities and respective training sessions in technical sectors for the Global environment. 
Academics: 
Northcap University, which however is not as well ranked as Sharda University, is also incapable of providing the required amount of exposure as needed for the industrial sectors. 
On the contrary, Sharda University being a greater institution in itself has various tie-ups with other higher organizations and foreign universities.
Faculty: 
Sharda University is bestowed with extremely friendly and highly professional professors which rather is the greater plus point for any respective stream. 
Northcap, as even mentioned by some of its students, comes up with a very poor record of having a group of inexperienced and unsupportive professors. The employability you will attain after pursuing B.Tech from Northcap is uncertain.
Sharda University has recorded well for the past few years to provide a good deployment rate in the B.Tech branch.

396,Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology - [PSIT],How is PSIT Kanpur for an MBA?,"PSIT Kanpur is among the top private engineering institutes in Kanpur. It is especially good for CS. The teaching methodology used is mostly theory oriented. There is less scope for exploring practical hands-on learning. 
Companies such as Capgemini, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, TCS, etc. visit PSIT placements. Students usually receive an average CTC of around INR 5-6 LPA. 
PSIT has strict rules in place regarding attendance. Students are required to maintain at least 90% attendance."
396,Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology - [PSIT],"What is your review of MBA in psit, Kanpur?","One of my friends availed hostel at PSIT Kanpur. Let me share whatever I got to know from him about the hostels.
The hostel in PSIT Kanpur offers 4 kinds of accommodation for the students. It includes - Double Sharing AC, Double Sharing Non AC, Triple Sharing AC, and Triple Sharing Non AC.
The best part is the centralized cooling AC which keeps the entire hostel cool.
The rooms also have fans included which can’t be used while the AC is on. You can operate one of them at a given time.
A desk and a cupboard are provided per occupant. The bed also has additional storage for the shoes and slippers.
Two adjacent rooms are connected by a well-spaced and big enough balcony with cloth lines to dry the clothes.
Services such as laundry are provided within the hostel premises with a fixed amount of clothing for tenure.
Although Wi-Fi is not available so you have to bring a LAN wire to access the hostel internet.
The first-year hostel is a whole separate building at a distance from the senior year hostels. It also has a separate mess which has a capacity of 1300+ students or more.
The washrooms are cleaned and well maintained.
The warden and the night takers are both well respected and loved among the students.
You also get two elevator services working 24*7. It can be used by anyone and has a backup facility if there’s any power failure. Thus, the hostel is well equipped for the students."

398,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT],What do you think about BIT Mesra Jaipur Campus?,"BIT Mesra Jaipur campus is one of the seven extension campuses (Jaipur, Deoghar, Patna, Lalpur, Noida, Muscat, and Ras Al Khaimah) and one polytechnic school managed by the BIT Mesra deemed university. Now it will be unfair to compare an extension campus to the main campus of any university as the overall quality of the extension campus always tends to be less than the main campus.
Keeping in line with that, the Jaipur campus of BIT Mesra has a smaller campus area than BIT Mesra’s main campus. 
The professors are also average and the facilities provided by the campus are also lesser compared to the main campus. 
One plus point is that some of the toppers and few meritorious students are called to the main campus for the final placements. 
The placements at the main campus are good with an average CTC of 11.76 LPA and the highest CTC of 49.76 LPA.
Now, the Jaipur campus of BIT Mesra is worth joining if you are looking for a brand name and a college with average output (this campus is still in the development phase). However, do not expect the level of quality offered at BIT Mesra. You may even consider joining some better-ranked and better-equipped state-level colleges in the vicinity."
398,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT],How is BIT Mesra Jaipur branch compared to LNMIIT?,"LMN Institute of Information & Technology and BIT Mesra are both premiere engineering institutes. The choice between two would lead to a clear cut decision for LNMIIT. 
It can be taken on the basis of factors like:
Placement
The placements are quite decent as it attracts the top companies across the country offering a good amount of packages. The career development opportunities are in quite a large number leading to a good growth in terms of career graph ahead. 
The data can be looked upon as follows:
Maximum Package Offered
Rs. 63.27 LPA
Median Package Offered
Rs. 10 LPA
Average Package Offered
Rs. 12.03 LPA
Recruiting Companies
Google, Uber, Samsung, HSBC, Amazon, Oyo, Ericson, Times Internet and Cognizant.
Faculty
There are qualified faculty members that make education more realistic and research oriented. They provide the best experience in their field, making it even more remarkable.
Coding Culture
BIT Mesra has a weaker coding culture in their campus unlike LMN IIT. The Cultural committee, Sports committee and literary club are important elements. 
Infrastructural Facility
A lot of hardships have been encountered on the part of accommodation in BIT Mesra, making it a deterrent altogether. Infrastructure is a major factor when you choose a college. 
LMNIIT on the other hand has provided good residential facilities with full access to important equipment without major administrative situations. 
The other important factor to be kept in mind is that BIT Mesra & Ranchi are two different colleges and the notion that Mesra campus is good so Jaipur is also good is clearly not acceptable. A clear point of view stands in favour of LNMIIT in purview of all the mentioned details."
398,Birla Institute of Technology - [BIT],Should I do IT at IIITM or BIT Mesra?,"BIT Jaipur is an integral part of BIT Mesra. It provides education in Engineering, Applied Sciences, and Management with professional exposure with ingenious programs and practices.

While LNCT offers good placements. According to the recent highlights, the average CTC offered is 3-8 LPA. In 2020 Microsoft offered the highest CTC of 27 LPA. 
On the other hand, if you are comparing BITS Pilani and LNCT Bhopal then without any second thoughts, Pilani is the answer. In order to get admission there, you should be able to crack their entrance exam (BITSAT) and it takes great effort."

Following are some reasons why you should choose NITTE Meenakshi.
It has a great campus with decent placement records, an excellent crowd, and above-average faculty.
The fact that it is an autonomous institution is like a cherry on the cake as the students don't have to face problems faced by VTU students. Being an autonomous university, it offers a great curriculum, student diversity, and modern infrastructure. 
The only con is the location which is away from the city, but there is good connectivity to the college.

So, on the basis of the above-highlighted information, it is safe to say NITTE Meenakshi is a better alternative."
423,SJB Institute of Technology - [SJBIT],"Which is the best, SJBIT, Global Academy of Technology, or JSSATE?","JSSATE should be most preferred among SJBIT and Global academy of technology not only because of the beautiful campus infrastructure but also better teaching facilities, academics excellence, better campus placement & reasonable fee structure (depending on admission category you choose to get admission). 
JSSATE has no dress code, unlike SJBIT. Various scholarships & relaxation can be availed for fee concession.
The table below shows the placement statistics of JSSATE:

JSSATE also provides little relaxation in-class attendance and strictness unlike the rest of the two. Global Academy of technology and SJBIT can burn your pockets if you belong to a middle-class family. So, if you're a self-motivated person and looking for little enjoyment in your graduation then definitely go for JSSATE. 
The next best option is SJBIT of having a comparatively better ranking and feasible transportation to reach a college campus. It offers better placement and the facility is also good. 
Lastly, it depends on you how you take maximum benefit out of your surroundings. Your success will depend on your hard work, time management, and the opportunities you grabbed."

429,GITAM,I got an MBA seat both in Hyderabad Central University and Gitam University Vizag. Which is better in terms of placements and faculty?,"Among Hyderabad Central University (HCU) and GITAM University Vizag, it is suggested that you go for Hyderabad Central University. 
Studying at Hyderabad Central University will be a much safer option, considering academics and placements.
Being a central university and entertaining politically affiliated student organizations on campus catches the attention of national media. 
The faculty is much more interactive here, and are more than willing to stay back after work if guidance is required.
GITAM has better hostels than Hyderabad Central University. 
HCU has much lower fees compared to GITAM.
Lastly, placements majorly depend on the individual and not on the institution. So, if you work hard no matter the institution, you will definitely secure a good placement offer from a reputed company."

433,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Bengaluru Campus,"Which college is better, Amrita Bangalore or BMSCE?","I know some people from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham so I think I can give you some idea about it.
M.Tech in Embedded Systems is a great course. As far as the choice between Bangalore and Coimbatore campuses is concerned, then without any doubt, Coimbatore campus is better between the two. Here are some details about the campuses.
Coimbatore Campus:
This course is offered by the Electrical and Electronics department. So if you are an electrical graduate, then it is better for you.
The department has very good lab facilities. There are various development boards and robotic kits which will help you increase your skills.
The faculty are very helpful and will help in every way both academically as well as publishing in your journals.
Bangalore Campus:
Here the course is offered by the Computer Science department. So if you are a CS graduate, then it is for you.
The labs, teaching experience, facilities, research opportunities, and exposure to the industry are also very good.
Considering all the points and knowing that Coimbatore is the original and the oldest campus of the two, the preference of the campuses should be Coimbatore."
433,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Bengaluru Campus,What are the placements of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Bangalore for CSE?,"PES University is undoubtedly better than Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bangalore campus. The most important decision should be whether to take Mechanical engineering or ECE as both are different disciplines and unrelated to each other as well. The choice of your engineering branch should be based on your passion and interest as you would have to study it for 4 years and then do a job in the same field as well.
After that, comes the college. These are some of the parameters on which you can compare the two universities.
Faculty – Their qualifications, experience, and the quality of teaching.

433,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Bengaluru Campus,How is Amrita University for an MTech in embedded systems? Which campus should I prefer between Coimbatore & Bangalore?,"ECE and CSE are two different departments, providing separate career opportunities. VIT Chennai and Amrita University Bangalore offer decent placement to students in these departments.
The points below give a brief overview of both the choices:
In CSE, there are excellent package offers in institutes like Amrita and VIT, thus increasing your chance of getting a good salary at the beginning of your career.
ECE is a stream of a kind, which has its own charm. In ECE, students grow slowly with time and earn decent salaries, provided they are passionate about the field of work.
ECE in VIT Chennai is a great department, having a world-class infrastructure. The curriculum is at par with the industry needs. The professors at VIT Chennai are connected to the industry and other academic institutes to aid in research.
All major electronics companies visit the campus of VIT Chennai for placement. Almost 20% of the students in the department get a package above 10 LPA in general from companies like Samsung, TI, Nutanix, etc.
A major percentage of about 70-80% of students in ECE at VIT Chennai get a package between 5-8 LPA. Companies like Cisco, Intel, Wipro VLSI, Arista Networks offer salaries in this range. There are also some non-tech companies like Deloitte, E&Y, Bank of America, PWC, Wells Fargo, etc that recruit students from ECE.
In VIT Chennai, there are very few students who opt for job offers in service-based companies like TCS, Accenture, Infosys, CTS, etc.
Therefore, both ECE at VIT Chennai and CSE at Amrita Bangalore are good options. It is the choice of the student as to what excites him/her the most and opts for a degree in the same."
433,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Bengaluru Campus,Is it advisable to take ECE or mechanical in PES University besides having a mechanical seat in Amrita Bangalore ready?,"One of my friends is a student at Amrita University, Bangalore pursuing CS. He has better opinions on the same.
The very first thing that you should be aware of is that there is no special kind of reservation or seat facilities for the OBC section.
Rather, what you can otherwise avail of our reservations for the SC and ST groups.
If you are considering anything other than that, then they’re possibly are the reservation criteria for the Home State quota.
Having said that, if you are moreover eligible for the Home State quota, then you are supposed to get facilities alike.
There however is no separate guarantee for that as well mainly until you have appeared for the counseling. Thus, you should attend the counseling.
In addition to all this, if you share an interest in the CSE branch, then pursuing the course at the Amrita University’s Amritapuri campus is supposed to be the best choice above all.
In a nutshell, you should monitor the seat availability status that is usually also published from time to time on the main website of the institute. It is suggested that you check that whenever necessary to keep pace with more information."

435,Periyar Maniammai Institute of Science and Technology - [PMIST],What are the advantages and disadvantages of Periyar Maniammai University?,"PMU is similar to other deemed-to-be universities. It offers really good programs and their Alumni network spreads far and wide. UGC issues orders every now and then and the intake of students is based on the principle of social justice i.eMerit and students from different backgrounds join in. There is both an advantage and a few disadvantages, which I am listing below:
Advantages: The Atmosphere is student friendly with a need based curriculum for students.
Disadvantages: The administrator resides at Chennai and you will face issues with speedy resolution and the placement needs to be pushed. 
This public trust institute also takes care of social needs, through the ‘Periyar Pura’ scheme shared by Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for women and the marginalised sections of the society."

Thank you"
443,Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R and D Institute of Science and Technology - [Vel Tech],How is life at Vel Tech University?,"A few of my friends graduated from Saveetha University and Vel Tech University and based on their experience I will say Saveetha University is better than the Vel Tech engineering college.
Saveetha University is the best because the college environment is excellent and has good faculty, good communications skills trainers. The college infrastructure is good with more labs, good teaching, and a friendly environment. The teaching methodology employed is quite good. There are only smart board classes. 
Placements are way better at Saveetha University as compared to Val Tech. According to the recent placement trends around 91% of students get placed from Saveetha University. 
Saveetha University is overall a better choice in terms of infrastructure, faculties, and placements."
443,Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R and D Institute of Science and Technology - [Vel Tech],Which is the better university between Saveetha and Vel Tech universities?,"Firstly, clear your mind regarding the ranking of Vel Tech University. It is still a deemed university which means it is still under development. The university does not hold any Asian Rank or even the country-wise rank, but it holds a decent rank in Tamil Nadu. The university is considered better than many North Indian Universities. 
Overall Vel Tech University has a good reputation among students and is considered good for academics and the rules that are being implemented here.
Lastly, we can conclude that do not look much into rank as nowadays paying more and attaining higher rank is not very difficult. Weigh the pros and cons of the university and then take your decision."
443,Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R and D Institute of Science and Technology - [Vel Tech],How is placement for a B.Tech from VEL Tech University?,"Being a Deemed-to-be-university, Veltech University is quite lenient when compared to other private universities. It has an amazing infrastructure.
Regarding the rules at the university, it is important to carry ID cards, formals, and various other things. You will not be allowed to enter the college premises if you are not wearing formals which include shoes, shirt, pants, and no jeans, T-shirt. 
Previously the classrooms had a blackboard, a platform for the staff, and no whitewashed walls. But now the university has improved it with Air-conditioning in every classroom. They’re not as big and developed as SRM but their classroom infrastructure is still remarkable as compared to its previous setup."
443,Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R and D Institute of Science and Technology - [Vel Tech],How did Vel Tech University get such a high rank on the top Asian universities list?,"I have a few friends from Vel Tech University and according to them, it is a decent college with affordable course fees. A B.E from Val Tech will cost you around 2 lakhs. 
Mainly IT companies visit the college campus to recruit students from IT, CSE, EEE branches. So, you will get decent placement opportunities. You will be placed if your aptitude and spoken English are good.
According to the recent placement highlights, around 90% of students are placed. The highest package last year was 12 LPA. The college has a placement cell that invites a number of companies. Some of the major recruiters visiting the campus placements are Google, Capgemini, Amazon, Vivo, etc. 
Career guidance programs are conducted twice a week. Some highly skilled professors are allocated for teaching online exams which are conducted under the guidance of the smart teaching staff."
443,Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R and D Institute of Science and Technology - [Vel Tech],"Can you tell me about Vel Tech University, Avadi, Chennai about its rules, regulations, and dress code? And which is the most lenient among hi-tech, multi-tech, and engineering?","My brother is from SRM, So I think I can give you some insight into the institute.
I have visited VelTech and found it to be an unappealing college. And if we talk about SRM for an MBA, then definitely it is a great deal, with so many events encouraging students to broaden their horizons. Vel tech is less expensive than SRM, Although the quality of education is better in SRM in comparison to Vel tech.
Here is a brief comparison of Vel Tech and SRM.
Parameter Vel Tech University  SRM
Course Fee  1.81 lakhs  7 lakhs 
Average CTC  17 LPA -
Highest CTC  28 LPA  35 LPA
Major recruiters  Infosys, Amazon, Byju’s Dell Cognizant, TCS, Wipro
So, you should go for SRM and if you want, you can also consult any senior of Vel tech because this will give you a better picture and decision-making will be easy for you."
443,Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr. Sagunthala R and D Institute of Science and Technology - [Vel Tech],"Which is better, Vels University or Veltech University?","VelTech is a good institute if we talk about the infrastructure, location, placements, faculty, and management. Check the following points for more insight into the institute:
You will be given the opportunity to get a full scholarship if you have appeared in VelTech entrance exam and if your 12th score is the highest in your state.
The students of CSE, Mechanical, and EEE can make the most of the facilities. However, the facilities for students pursuing Aeronautics are not up to the mark, unfortunately. 
Compared to other private institutes, VelTech promises better placements to its students.
The curriculum here focuses more on practical learning than theoretical knowledge. This helps the students to think in a broader way and improve their ideas.
VelTech also has collaboration with foreign universities in Taiwan, Japan. Apart from internship opportunities, you will also get the chance to pursue your studies abroad with full financial backing from VelTech.
It is the first institute in the country that took on the initiative of CDIO for the quality of education. The fee structure is also constructed in such a way that people from all sections of society can seek admission."

These are said to be rumors spread by rival institutions. Let me share some of the facts which might clear your views regarding the institution. 
The placements are not affected as notable companies keep on visiting the campus. SJCE has maintained a good relationship with the companies
The institute sets its own syllabus, which is industry-oriented unlike that of VTU which is not usually updated.
SJCE is known for its brand, the name is not removed from the degrees and is often mentioned by recruiters in India and abroad.
The degree programs are accredited by NBA and the degree awarded by the University is recognized by countries that have signed the Washington accord. So, while applying for PG in other countries, your degree has its value.
It follows the OBE system and has 5 events per subject which are similar to the model followed by foreign universities, unlike VTU who still follows the age-old internals concept.
It is suggested that you do not go by rumors spread by rival institutions. You can definitely put your trust in SJCE, as it stands strong as one of the notable educational institutions in Karnataka."

At present times, engineering is somewhat an overrated course, if studied from an average institute. 
The points below give a brief overview of the present conditions of engineering from this kind of institute.
In engineering, only premier institutes like IITs, NITs, BITS, and other top regional institutes provide effective academics and placement. Other than those, a good job is a myth in most cases.
There is a lot of shrink in opportunities after engineering with time. Companies are reducing the number of intakes, mostly in core sectors. So, it is better to think well and then take admission, and obviously in a stream that has some placement in it.
Neither of the institutes mentioned in the question is very good in engineering studies. So, you should not expect a decent job from these institutes.

467,Jaya Engineering College - [JEC],"Which is the better option, ET in IET DAVV or CSE in JEC?","A few of my friends graduated from both IET DAVV and JEC. They say that the choice mostly varies according to your interests and the plans you have for your future.
If you are planning for GATE then ET will not be a good choice. But if you are thinking of campus placements then IET has better records of placements than JEC.
There is no more chance of growth in ET compared to CS. You will get better placements with CSE but for exposure and environment, IET is the better one.
You will find good seniors and quite a supportive faculty.
Talking of the colleges’ locations, Indore is better than Jabalpur not only fits your plans but also an important parameter while choosing a college.
Categories ET in IET DAVV CSE in JEC
Course Fee 2.74 lakh 22,300 (1st year)
Highest CTC 20 LPA 7-9 LPA
Average CTC 6 LPA 3.5 LPA
Recruiting Companies TCS, Phillips, Tech Mahindra, Mu Sigma, etc. Wipro, Persistence, Capgemini, Infosys, etc.
Finally, IET is a better college compared to JEC but the ET course at IET is mediocre while the CS branch has a great scope. However, the final decision is up to you. Choose wisely."

470,MCKV Institute of Engineering - [MCKVIE],Which college should I choose between AIIMS Patna or MCK?,"AIIMS Patna and Medical College Kolkata (MCK) both seem to have their own perks in the different areas of anyone’s interest. Here are some facts that you need to know before making any decision.
AIIMS Patna
Many believe that AIIMS Patna is a very new college but you can not avoid the fact that it is an AIIMS. 
Due to the same reason, it is very well recognized abroad so go for it if studying abroad is your goal ultimately. 
Also, it is well funded therefore the infrastructure and campus are of a top-notch level. 
The teaching faculty as well is on a better level than MCK. 
They have got all the co-curricular activities covered too. 
Medical College Kolkata (MCK)
MCK is not a centrally aided institute so the infrastructure lacks a bit more than that of AIIMS Patna. 
But the environment is a very healthy one without any political interference in the college procedures. 
The greatest perk is that it is a 180-year-old college which results in a huge alumni network. 
Also, if you are a student from Kolkata then you fall in the state reservation quota of 50%, unlike AIIMS. 
Both the colleges are good at their own places, choose the one that suits your requirements. This will be a major step up for your career."

This is harmful in the long run because they are not able to build a strong base of knowledge for their respective subject which will reflect in their performance in the government conducted exams or during their interviews during the placement procedure.
