Additionally, the college charges fees for even minor events, and if students fail to pay these fees before the semester exams, they are unable to generate their exam hall tickets. I estimate that, beyond the tuition fees, the college collects an extra ?1 lakh from other fees over the course of four years. There's no option for students to choose whether they want to attend an event or not; they are required to pay the event fee regardless.
