8,SRM Engineering College,"I reside in the hostel. Trust me. It takes more than patience and endurance to survive in a hostel like this. It doesnt come at par with the amount of money you pay for the hostels. The hostel rooms consist of 3 beds per room, well the beds resemble hospital beds to be precise. And it comes with irregularly sized cupboards for you and your friends. The Bathrooms are dirty and most of the time you will be welcomed with foul smell as cleaning is done on a weekly basis. Some of the Bathrooms are broken and have not been repaired for a very long time. The rooms are mostly uncomfortable and will suffocate you for the first few months. Well its suffocating most people still now. The lift of the hostel will not be working most of the time. So good luck if your room is in or above the 5th floor. The rooms will be three sharing for the Non AC rooms, whereas for AC rooms the sharing may go upto 12 sharing rooms. There are 3 buildings namely BH 1,2,3. I paid 62000 for the Hostel rooms . The food in the mess will be terrible for the first few months.After that you will adapt to it. But, if you are a North Indian and a foodie, it will be terrible to the day you decide to cut your tongue off. There are a variety of South Indian delicacies which try and sometimes succeed in impressing your taste buds. But, some people wont like the taste of it at all. SRM doesnt have any PG's at all."

The hostel which is inside the campus is known as D-hostel and doesn't has good food. The food is of very bad quality. There are two girls hostel, one is very costly around 250000 per year and has very high facilities and other is around 110000 and has normal facilities with bad quality of food, due to which the girls do not even eat food and end up getting weak. I live in a flat outside the campus, from a 5 minutes walking distance and the atmosphere at the night at the streets of the college is not good as there are many locals which are just roaming and disturbing the croud."

38,Bannari Amman Institute of Technology - [BIT],There are two types of room 2 sharing and four sharing and there is separate hostels based on the year. Meal quality is good but as I said earlier there is no non-veg in the meal menu. There is no complications in the registration for the hostel. It is just the easy process.

It's you rented a pg it's just outside the campus making it very near
39,Institute of Engineering and Management - [IEM],"I opted for hostel. I will straight up say, since there is no campus so the hostel is nothing but a medium sized apartment. And if you can see a PG paying guest), go there. Do not opt for hostel. They will take your hard earned money for a whole year so you are bound to stay there. And the hostel is full of restrictions and its connectivity to the main market place and other areas is also very diificult. Meal quality is okayish, nothing great to expect. You would get the normal Daal, Roti, Sabzi, puri, paratha at times. Chowmein slathering in oil, maybe poha a day, idli etc. The two areas where the PG s are Nayapatti and Mahishbatan. Out of the two I would say go for NAyapatti. It has good environment. All the necessary items, fast food chains, places to chill a bit with your friends etc. are also present and IN PGs there is no restriction. You can roam around freely till 11pm unlike in Hostel where the gates are cosed by 7:30 pm. Unbelieavable !"
39,Institute of Engineering and Management - [IEM],"My Hostel room is quite comfy, and the room feels good. The food is mid. 5/10. It's not that bad but not enjoyable as well.

The main problem is the students who live their. They smoke, drink and all but I don't think there's any disturbance in the neighborhood ."

Few rooms have attached bathrooms but as I said its a bit confusing you need to talk to 'Sir' to get the best out of everything available.

As for my rented accommodation, the rooms aren’t too small, but comfortable. However, there are also many restrictions to follow, but the worst part is our mess food, it is very horrible that students use to skip meals for days. and during holidays and outings it takes so much time, waiting, patcience and we need to follow around faculty for permissions for 4-5 days before actuall outing."

83,KLE Technological University,Since I am a localite from Hubli I did not opt for a hostel facility from the college but heard very good reviews from my friends who stayed there over a span of 4 years no complaints here wardens are very strict they keep a strict vigil on all the activities happening
84,RMK Engineering College - [RMKEC],"Room is very moderate compare to other college rooms for the same fee structure they have more facilities and for the Ac rooms from 2024 is 200000 its very high so it's moderate in food I""ll give 5 out of 5 its very clean tasty and hygiene here"
84,RMK Engineering College - [RMKEC],"There will be seperate bed for everyone, well cleaned washroom, cleaned 3-4 times a day Meal quality is good, 5 times nonveg per week PG is not supported by the college, there are no nearby PG around the college"
84,RMK Engineering College - [RMKEC],"There is only 2fans for 5 students and rooms are small ,there are cupboards inside the rooms. The meal and quality of the food is too good and the menu is non veg for 5 days . The hostel fees are 1,00,000 and the rooms are not worthy."
84,RMK Engineering College - [RMKEC],In the college they provide seperate hostels for the boys and girls. And the rooms in the hotel was 4 share.There is no attached bathroom common bathrooms for all.The rooms and the bathrooms were maintained very well. There is no ac rooms.
84,RMK Engineering College - [RMKEC],"Coming to hostels, accommodation is good and the food that serve is the best when compared to other colleges of Tamilnadu. Our collge have veg and non veg options for students everyday to choose with. We get served non veg 5 times in a week those who go for non veg mess.The food that served here in our college is completely made in the college itself right from farming vegtables and paddy etc., We are provided with cricket ground, 2 volley ball court, badminton court. Hostels are allowed to have 24 hours high speed wifi facility with a hair saloon and reading room. a minimum of 4 to 5 members are encouraged in one room. Finding a PG near to college is bit difficult beacuse the college is located at outskirts of state."
85,MIT World Peace University - [MIT-WPU],Hostel Is Just 400-500 m Away From College Hostel And Mess Facilities Are Really Goof Or Average Compared To Other Private Mess Facilities It Costs You Around 70000 For Hostel and 45000 For Mess With Additional 50000 deposit Pretty Average In My Opinion
85,MIT World Peace University - [MIT-WPU],"I used to live in private hostel . The hostel is 5 minutes away from MIT academy of engineering college. My hostel has 50000 rupees for year . There are some facilities like cot , hot water , cupboard , table chair."
85,MIT World Peace University - [MIT-WPU],I am living in hostel and I got a double sharing room the room is quite spacious we got bad study table and almirah personal Wi-Fi for 24/7 The quality of food is not great overall The registration process is that you go to the MIT WPU site and you can choose which hostel you want to take according to your preferences
85,MIT World Peace University - [MIT-WPU],hostel in which i live is located in ambegao which have good rooms of three sharing and two sharing and food is decent its not very good but negative point is location as it is located almost 11km away from college and we have to travel 1 hours daily in bus and the point is we don't even got a seat in bus
85,MIT World Peace University - [MIT-WPU],WIFI is there in the room and the storage space is pretty good. There is a gym in the hostel but its pretty crowded most of the time.The food quality is okay not that good.I would rate the hostel 0 in affordability cuz its located in an isolated area and then rent is costly compared to others.
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],So there is private hostel which is affiliated to college but i dont recommand to join these hostel boz there is 100000 fees for one year. as if you girl then you can join but boys you can get any room/flat near college which is affordeble.
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],Hostel is at 2km from college so it is advised that you take a PG or flat nearby.Fees of hostel are 1lakh per year which include hostel plus meals.Hostel is very clean meal quality is average.I rented a PG in saavkash nagar madhushalini hostel
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],I took college hostel. The Hostel is 3km away from college and believe me you can't eat in that mess ( it's a mess). You are provided with breakfast and dinner no lunch no snacks and infrastructure of hostel is good
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],I live as a paying guest (PG). The owners are friendly and helpful. The atmosphere around the PG is also calm and peaceful allowing to concentrate on study. The PG is 10 - 15 mins away from Viit college by walking.
86,Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology - [VIIT],"The college hostel is vert nice stay but it is little bit away from campus like 1.5 km otherwise it is good.There is Daily cleaning and washing machine are being provided to wash clothes. You get a table,bed,lights and wardrobe in your room amd there is common water filter for drinking water. The hostel mess is good but they don't provide luch only breakfast and dinner. You need to come at start of academic year to register for the hostel and it is affordable choice."
87,Anurag University,For each floor there are 20 rooms.There is boys and girls hostel separately. Hostel food was average and non veg will be served once in a week. Washing machines are available and there are AC and Non AC rooms. Hostel has floors. In eacch room 4-5 people were there.There are many private hostels available which are near to college.
87,Anurag University,"Our hostel is so good enough for our daily needs they provide a room with 5 beds for 5 members and 5 lockers,each student can have one locker and the food in the hostel is amazing I will never regret joining in the hostel because it has the most experienced cooks and the wifi,hot water,lift,facility is available in the hostel"
87,Anurag University,"Hostel facilties provided by college are rated good. I could rate 4.5 out of 5. Food in the mess is good. Students will provided with milk and tea in the morning and evening. Break fast and dinner will be provided in the hostel and lunch will provided in the college as students can have fresh cooked food and they need not carry box and for the students who stay back in the hostel they will also be provided food in the hostel. The rooms are categorised into 3 types common washroom, attached washroom with AC and without AC. In common washroom rooms 4 people are accommodated in each room and cost is 1lakh per annum. In AC and non AC attached washroom rooms 3 people are accommodated in each room and cost is 1lakh 10thousand for non AC and 1lakh 20 thousand for AC rooms and AC current bill must be shared by the room members. the hostel feeses may vary now. To get hostel facility the student has to apply for hostel when they come to college for admissions."
87,Anurag University,"Affordable Hostels, Neat and clean rooms Wifi, and hot water for 24 hours and melas quality are the best and the rooms are organised and secured. Just go through the reception and join the process is easy. PG's are also available in the locatilty like Jodimetla,medipally, etc."
87,Anurag University,Generally I had stayed in the college hostel for 4 years. They provide good food. Good rooms with proper cleaning. Good water facility. Good beds. Good warden and with 24 hours security. Good interiors and exteriors.
88,Narula Institute of Technology - [NIT Agarpara],Hostel are nice to stay. The fees are 33000 each semester and they provide good facilities but the food was not good the manager is so rude. The provide no ac or cooler for summer and thats why is hard to survive
88,Narula Institute of Technology - [NIT Agarpara],"Hostel facility is also quite good. Food is not so good but overall everything is fine with the hostel. Staffs , warden and everyone is just so helpful and present whenever you need. Hostel is quite affordable. It's basically 6000 per month that's quite affordable."
88,Narula Institute of Technology - [NIT Agarpara],"In my opinion hostel facility is too good. There are 4 hostel for girls and I think 5 hostel for boys. 1 girls hostel is in College campus and other 2 is Just infront of the College and one is little bit far in the comparison of other college and boys hostels is also little bit far means approx 500 meter. Hostel provide us breakfast, lunch, evening snacks and dinner. There are 4 bathrooms on every floor and each have shower, geaser. I think college hostel is better than other PG/ flats and hostels. Because it is Affordable and if you want to get a pg then that are costly than college hostels"
88,Narula Institute of Technology - [NIT Agarpara],"Room type 2beds 3beds 4beds security TV,gym,indoor game,table tennis,medical facility ,cctv,electricity , water. meal quality is good you feel like home food.5000 registration fee of hostel of fooding and staying.near the many typs of room and pg are available"

89,PES College of Engineering - [PESCE],"There is 24x7 water, electricty and WiFi available. There are fans, a cot, a study table per student, bathroom(common or attached) and cupboards. There are 3 different messes. One is a pure vegetarian and the other two messes primarily serve vegetarian food with exception for 2 days in the week where non vegetarian food is served. The regisstration process is quite simple and follows standard procedures where a form is to be filled with a parent and local guardian present. A deposit of 35,000 is compulsory while joining which will be returned when you decide to leave the hostel."
89,PES College of Engineering - [PESCE],Hostel mainly had 3 blocks. For first year they will allot only two blocks one is IT Block which is 3 sharing with common bathrooms and the other one is NB block which is 3 sharing with attached bathrooms. Hostel has 3 canteens one is hostel mess the food would be in South Indian style and Non veg is provided the other one is Namdari it is a Jain kind of mess which only VEG and they don't even use oninons and garlics in their food the last one is Food Court where u get Chinese items and non veg is also provided. For the hostel process u have to get a form from the office then fill u r details and the amount should be paid only in Demand Draft at first
89,PES College of Engineering - [PESCE],"Hostel facility is good, 4 times food + laundry + security. For 10 months the fees is 160k for single rooms and 145k for sharing rooms. Which means 16k per month is very good considering the fact that were getting so much facilities. Outside PG has less rent but the facilities are also less."
89,PES College of Engineering - [PESCE],Hostel facilities was like 100000 per year before but now it has almost come to 1.5. They provide food facilities and the cut off timings to enter back into the hostel is 8. So in terms of safety it is a good place to get into. And food is kinda of ok.
89,PES College of Engineering - [PESCE],"I stayed in college hostel, we had a 3 times food in a day with different varities of menu. Each floor is provided with the wifi facilities. Rooms are avaliable in two sharing, three sharing and single sharing."
90,Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College - [SVEC],The hostel facility is like the 5 star hotels. You will be given the large 6 floors of hostel there are many rooms and nearly like 2000 students in it. The fees also a little bit high starting from 100000
90,Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College - [SVEC],The hostel fee is very high ranging from 80 thousand to 1.2 lakh .and the food quality is very worst you can't eat. Daily routine food is not special for breakfast you have only 3 to 4 varieties. The rooms are small and the WIFI is good and they have common bathrooms.
90,Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College - [SVEC],"In the Room, they provide the AC and they provide the electric kettle and hot water for 24 hours a day. Better Meals in the State is available in the college and Menu is changed day by day. They serve different dishes. The registration process is totally online first we consult the Accommodation head to fix the fee then onwards totally online. I took the college Hostel for safety and to get better Accommodation compared to the PG hostel college hostel is safe for all."
90,Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College - [SVEC],Hostels are pretty good but food can be a great problem. please choose pg over college hostels there are more pgs around the college environment so consider pg as the first priority. prices are more than 1 lakh so high costs.
90,Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College - [SVEC],"In the hostels there will be a and non AC and there is 4 sharing and 8 sharing and for 4sharing ac the hostel fee is 1,12,750.for 4 non AC the fee is 89000.the menu will be quite worst but it's ok on some days"
91,"Manav Rachna International Institute Of Research And Studies, Faculty of Engineering and Technology - [MRIIRSFET]",Hostel facilities are very good they are easy to register and very affordable for financial week families and the hostel is maintained throughout the day and the maintenance is very good we get the food four times a day including breakfast lunch snacks and then dinner and there is also at 24/7 restaurant you can order also and there are facilities for hostel student such as a you can use library up to 12
91,"Manav Rachna International Institute Of Research And Studies, Faculty of Engineering and Technology - [MRIIRSFET]",rent is very high and facilities are very less. food is very bad in taste and quality. They also do partiality in food and give better food to international students. we have complained many times but nothing happens about food. there many restrictions in hostel too and these restrictions are increasing every year. they are also increasing fees/rent of hostel ever year. the charges are different depending on the services you opt for. in fist year i gave hostel rent as 125000 and now in my third year it is 145500.
91,"Manav Rachna International Institute Of Research And Studies, Faculty of Engineering and Technology - [MRIIRSFET]","2 Seater rooms are pretty good and well convenient but the 4 Seater rooms are not upto the mark. the price of 2 Seater AC room is 218500 per year but of the 4 Seater AC is 175000. laundry services are good here but I'll say the total hostel fees is a bit high and also it increases every year. mess food is really a 'mess', there is zero variety in food and maximum times you'll feel like ordering from somewhere. also the hostel gates close at 9:30 so you can't order anything from outside then."
91,"Manav Rachna International Institute Of Research And Studies, Faculty of Engineering and Technology - [MRIIRSFET]","The hostels are only provided to 1st year students in campus and later students are shifted outside the campus. The food and mess is good enough and not that pricey but the amount you pay for hostel is much more than what you will pay living in a independent rented apartment. There are lot of PG's nearby in Sector-21 and Greenfield, which you can use but they have pretty strict restrictions due to past experiences. The average rental for a 2BHK independent flat is around 10K."
91,"Manav Rachna International Institute Of Research And Studies, Faculty of Engineering and Technology - [MRIIRSFET]",Campus Life:Campus life is good. the infrastructure is really amazing. The clubs are also there. Where you can upskill your passion as well with your studies. There are many library in my college having wide range of books.
92,Vasavi College of Engineering,There will be no hostel provided in the college and Students should Live. around 3 to 4 km from far away from the college. Narsinghi is the best place For students to live in Hotstals I have rented narsinghi
92,Vasavi College of Engineering,Our college has no hostel facility. so I presently staying in a private hostel i.e stanza living which is 5km from the college. the food options are good and the rooms are very neat. From this hostel to the college the transport facility is easy.
92,Vasavi College of Engineering,Vasavi doesn't provide any hostel facility for its students we should stay outside near the hostel are less so I am staying in Gachibowli 12km away from the college good food but low maintenance by the hostel but we get what we want outside.
92,Vasavi College of Engineering,"Hostel facilities are good. I am living in 4 share room it was good with many facilities, no power problem. Meal was good, tasty.
